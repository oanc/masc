       I think that's recording now.
    
    
      
    
    
      O_K, I'm on -
    
    
      
    
    
      I'm talking on mike  two. 
    
    
      So,
    
    
      Which channel is that?
    
    
      
    
    
      Um,
    
    
      do it again.
    
    
      Mike number  two,  I'm talking right  now  on?
    
    
      That's uh -
    
    
       Mike  number two?
    
    
      That's in channel one.
    
    
       Channel  one?
    
    
      Is that channel  one  or channel  zero?  
    
    
      Channel one.
    
    
      Channel one.
    
    
       Let me make sure .
    
    
      There are no -
    
    
      There's only one connection element.
    
    
      which is  zero-based  or  one-based? 
    
    
      It's zero-based.
    
    
      
    
    
      O_K, So we're  not  going to do that. O_K.
    
    
      Unfortunately the mikes are   you know  -
    
    
      This - this has the disadvantage of needing to put the numbers on the mikes.
    
    
       off  by one.
    
    
      Consistently not equal to the numbers - numbers on the channels.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Wh- that's why I wanted to write it  down, 
    
    
      but
    
    
      
    
    
       
    
    
      Dan just  doesn't  want to do that. 
    
    
      Well
    
    
      Well, you can write it down.
    
    
       I mean   Write down whatever you like.
    
    
      Thank you.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Write down that poem.
    
    
      
    
    
      Let us know when you're done, though
    
    
      cuz we want to start the meeting. 
    
    
      Now, how do you do the mike?
    
    
      O_K, now, that means - if  I'm  going to be standing in  there  looking, 
    
    
      I keep getting it in my nose.
    
    
       I  don't  know. 
    
    
      You can do whatever - any way you like.
    
    
      Oh!  
    
    
      Oh!  This  is good. 
    
    
      then someone  else  has to write them  down.  
    
    
      Oh! I  like  this.
    
    
       because I won-
    
    
      The  weird  thing is that
    
    
      I like this. 
    
    
      um it means that it
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      varies when you move your head around but -
    
    
      Fine.
    
    
       
    
    
      I think it's probably the better solution.
    
    
      Let's not try  to do anything too  easy.  
    
    
       I  like this, this is  much  more comfortable.
    
    
      O_K?
    
    
      Testing.
    
    
      
    
    
      I could have it more at the  midline. 
    
    
       Boy!  It's  very    adjustable  now.
    
    
      
    
    
       So go ahead .
    
    
       I'm  on number  four. 
    
    
      Do we have the numbers?
    
    
      the- the sheets, that we did from last time? so we can do them again?
    
    
      Can -
    
    
      So we can do them again? Yeah.
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      They're  in the folder right there.
    
    
      Great.
    
    
      May I pass the folder to Dan?
    
    
      You  may. 
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      So,  Jane,  can you  talk  into your  mike?  You said it's mike  four? 
    
    
      I'm mike - I'm on mike four.
    
    
      and it's a very nice microphone,
    
    
      Well, hmm,
    
    
      very modern.
    
    
      I'm  glad  you  like  it.
    
    
      
    
    
      I like it very much.
    
    
       Uh
    
    
       Eric,  what  mike  are you?
    
    
      I'm on channel one -
    
    
      Mike one -
    
    
       Mike  one, channel  zero,  probably.
    
    
      Looks like it. S- talk again?
    
    
      Channel  zero. 
    
    
      Thank you.
    
    
      
    
    
      I'm on uh
    
    
      mike  three. 
    
    
      This is mike  three, 
    
    
      coming in here.
    
    
      It's moving around as I move my head
    
    
      backwards and forwards.
    
    
      So that's just the way it goes. That's life.
    
    
      That's just what it does.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      You didn't get the s- head restraint with your system?
    
    
      
    
    
      That's right.
    
    
      Head restraint system?
    
    
      I did modify my-
    
    
      my mike uh distance from my
    
    
       speaking  apparatus. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Um, can you  do taps on the P_D_As?
    
    
      Slightly.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      and the
    
    
      P_Z_Ms?  And you have to actually check what the nu-
    
    
      P_Z_Ms? or -  or  not  P_Z_Ms?
    
    
      The-
    
    
       Start  with P_Z_Ms.
    
    
      Because  this  is P_Z_M number  three.  
    
    
      
    
    
      Thank you.
    
    
      Let's list them in order.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      P_Z_M number three was the furthest away.
    
    
      This is the next one in, which is P_Z_M number four, 
    
    
      apparently. 
    
    
      
    
    
      I can't tell.  
    
    
      P_Z-
    
    
      What- Can you - can you see  other  stuff happening?
    
    
      Yep. 
    
    
      This is P_Z_M number  four. 
    
    
      Thanks.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
       That's  a good way.
    
    
      This is P_Z_M  two. 
    
    
      
    
    
      F_ 
    
    
      Thank you.
    
    
      And this is P_Z_M one.
    
    
      which is closest to the machine room.
    
    
      Which -
    
    
      Should I draw a map?
    
    
      O_K. 
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      I mean 
    
    
      And P_D_A,  left, right? 
    
    
      I don't know.
    
    
      
    
    
      It's all hopeless. 
    
    
      This is uh one side of P_D_A, I guess. 
    
    
      We could actually  give  these sides  names,  right?
    
    
      This would be  left,   wouldn't  it. 
    
    
      I don't  see  anything. 
    
    
      I know,  but I'm just   asking. 
    
    
      Huh-uh. 
    
    
      He's labeling - he's labeling right now.
    
    
      I wasn't  asking  you. 
    
    
      He's?
    
    
      Ah.
    
    
      This is - this is  P_D_A   left. 
    
    
      Now.
    
    
      You getting something there? 
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      And this is  P_D_A   right. 
    
    
       All  O_K.
    
    
      They will
    
    
      Thank you.
    
    
      vary in future.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
       Because it depends which one of these
    
    
      Did  we  just  record  all that? Should we  start  it  over? 
    
    
      shows more  consistency  then.
    
    
      No.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Well, we're w- we're  so  ahead of the game now, cuz we've got
    
    
      built-in  downsampling  now.
    
    
      We have what? What do we have?
    
    
      We've got  built-in  downsampling.
    
    
      And so it's only recording  sixteen kilohertz data, and we've got -
    
    
       Wait  a second.
    
    
      We're not select- We're not recording the empty channels.
    
    
      The ones that  aren't  filled out are the  ones  you want to  hand  out.
    
    
      What about the ones that we  didn't   record? 
    
    
      No, I was looking for the ones -
    
    
      I  threw  the  ones    out,  that we already
    
    
      recorded but we didn't  record.  
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      O_K?
    
    
      Well, then, fine.
    
    
      Fine.
    
    
      
    
    
      Then it doesn't  matter,   does  it.
    
    
      See if we care.
    
    
      Well done.
    
    
      Well done.
    
    
      
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      You're probably wondering why I
    
    
      brought you all here today. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      But before w-
    
    
      before we -
    
    
       Before  that.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      
    
    
      So the first task is to read some digits.
    
    
       Before  that.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      So I'll go ahead and start.
    
    
      And 
    
    
      This is  Adam  on
    
    
      mike number  two, 
    
    
      
    
    
      and I'm reading transcript one one one dash one three O_.

      So. If you could just fill out the form,  and then
    
    
      later on we'll read it,
    
    
      with pauses between.
    
    
      Good.
    
    
      And we're session  two. 
    
    
      Shall I -
    
    
      Do you wanna read next, or d- ?
    
    
      n-
    
    
      I'd like to hear one -
    
    
      Let her fill it out and go ahead and read.
    
    
      Yeah, I'd like to hear one more.
    
    
       uh 
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Um, this is Eric on
    
    
      
    
    
      mike  one, 
    
    
      the wireless  lapel,  channel  zero. 
    
    
      um,
    
    
      reading transcript one seventy-one dash one ninety.

      Could I hear you next?
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      So, this is Dan
    
    
      on mike three,
    
    
      wireless headset, I'm wearing it around my  neck. 
    
    
      which may be different than wearing it on the head.
    
    
      And the  transcript  is one fifty-one to one seventy. 
    
    
      eight one 
    
    
      nine two two six 
    
    
      O_ nine seven

      five one seven one four two six 
    
    
      six four six 
    
    
      seven six one one 
    
    
      eight seven two four six three seven 
    
    
      nine 
    
    
      O_

      five 
    
    
      six seven eight 
    
    
      seven 
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      So,  basically  they're kind of like  sentences  but with n-
    
    
       numbers  instead of  words.  O_K.
    
    
      So, I'm - I'm on uh number  four 
    
    
      with the  microphone   around my neck
    
    
      and I will
    
    
      read  these. 
    
    
      So you wanna  pause   briefly between each one
    
    
      so that the person transcribing can tell  where one ends and one begins.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      So, a short sentence between each line.
    
    
       And - 
    
    
      It  really  sounds like  sentences. 
    
    
      Your intonation sounds like -
    
    
      Well,  you can  intone  it however you  want.  Imagine that you're
    
    
       somewhat  like  sentence   intonation.  
    
    
      
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah?
    
    
      reading a number -  phone  number to someone.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      Um,
    
    
      O_K.

       Good.  Thanks.
    
    
      Great.
    
    
      So we'll probably do another one at the end  of the meeting.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      just to get some more digits.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      And, uh
    
    
      
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      
    
    
      Thank you.
    
    
       
    
    
      If I were to be dictating a  phone  number, I would have done that
    
    
      more  slowly,  but
    
    
      uh -
    
    
      which would have been
    
    
       easier  for the -
    
    
      of course,
    
    
      for the  machine. 
    
    
      But.
    
    
      Sure.
    
    
      Was that an O_K pace?
    
    
      It's kind of  weird. 
    
    
      Yeah. It's fine.
    
    
      That was  great,  what you  did. 
    
    
      Um
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Just as long as it's with -
    
    
      you know,
    
    
      What- what's your  mike  number,  Jane? 
    
    
       uh  within the constraints.
    
    
      Number four.
    
    
      Oh,
    
    
      Sorry.
    
    
       Dan  doesn't remember what  sex  he is.
    
    
      Yeah, cuz I  figure  no one's going to be able to  figure  it  out 
    
    
      from the - from my  name.  So,
    
    
      That's true, it's - it's really difficult.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      and the voice. Just no way.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Well, don't you - I - I wrote a  scanner  program that  scans  these  forms  in.
    
    
      Oh, right, right, right.
    
    
       @@ 
    
    
       Anyway.  So,  why  did I  call  you all here?
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      
    
    
      Um, what I'd  like  to talk about is, um
    
    
      Oh,  you  did.
    
    
      the transcription.
    
    
      So, as  part  of this um  project,  we need to  transcribe  these  meetings. 
    
    
      um, to do  training  and  test  and so on.
    
    
      and, uh, so we need
    
    
       word  transcripts
    
    
      and,
    
    
      uh, speaker  change  identification.
    
    
      So,  speaker  I_D.
    
    
      And, uh
    
    
      so I'd sort of like to know   who's  going to do that, 
    
    
      hi Jane,
    
    
      and uh 
    
    
       what  tools to use,  what other resources you might  need, 
    
    
      and  also  what we -
    
    
      things like just the data format
    
    
      and
    
    
       how  we're going to  do  it.
    
    
      So, I'm just curious how - how - h-
    
    
      how exactly you got roped  into  this.
    
    
      I mean -
    
    
      Oh. 
    
    
      Um, because my name was -
    
    
      was mentioned when I wasn't around, but I'm most happy.
    
    
      
    
    
      O_K. Good.
    
    
      Oh really? Cuz Morgan said he  asked  you.
    
    
      Oh, uh he  did. 
    
    
      and - and I  approved. 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      but I think that I was
    
    
      uh
    
    
      proposed before I was asked?
    
    
      And that doesn't matter
    
    
      cuz I think there was probably an a-
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      uh
    
    
      Yeah. That would be m-
    
    
      y- an indication that -
    
    
      That would be  my  fault.
    
    
      that I was interested in advance
    
    
      and, in which case, I  thank  you. 
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Uh
    
    
      right.
    
    
      And so, one of the  first  questions is,
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      "do you need  help? "
    
    
      Well,  hang  on.
    
    
      Oh?
    
    
      That's  not  the first question.
    
    
      Well, 
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Well, I  guess. 
    
    
      Do you - So, do you -
    
    
      What are - what are we  talking  about? That you're gonna -
    
    
      you're gonna do  transcriptions?  You're going to listen to these things and -
    
    
      I'm going to provide -
    
    
      I'm going to be -
    
    
      once I'm given the
    
    
      data, I will provide
    
    
      w- word-level  transcripts  
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      with
    
    
      uh indication of speakers,
    
    
      and
    
    
      um
    
    
      I guess speaker  change  in any case, so
    
    
      speaker I_D,
    
    
      and words.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      So you're gonna
    
    
      do the actual transcription yourself.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      D- I- And do you have a clear - I mean, is that -
    
    
      Do you sort of -
    
    
      Are you going to have to make  up  what you do or do you have a very
    
    
       clear   idea  of what you're going to  do? 
    
    
      So I mean, is it - is it -
    
    
      Well
    
    
      Is this l-
    
    
      Is it  like something you've done before? or -
    
    
      I've transcribed a  lot. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      But um e-
    
    
      you know,
    
    
      the -
    
    
      I mean, there are always ways of doing things
    
    
      And,
    
    
      more  efficiently  or
    
    
      more
    
    
      uh -
    
    
      in a more technical- technically sophisticated way?
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Do you have to speak
    
    
      true English sentences when you do this?
    
    
      Yeah, because as- people are going to be listening to it afterwards and saying
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      "Oh listen to  her.  She couldn't even speak true English  sentences! "
    
    
      "She can't speak!" 
    
    
      
    
    
      "It's terrible!"
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      O_K,
    
    
      So 
    
    
      Oh, you're meant - You're meant to speak naturally. You're meant to say
    
    
      um
    
    
      
    
    
      " Oh,  I didn't  realize  we were being recorded!"
    
    
      Ah  right.
    
    
       Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      "No one told me that."
    
    
      "This  microphone,  what's  this  doing around my neck?"
    
    
      Uh, that's -  I - I was saying before we don't really have to  worry  about people being  surprised  by it. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      It's just -
    
    
      It's just  jewelry. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      O_K, so um
    
    
      typically, what I w- you know I - in -
    
    
      uh
    
    
      i-
    
    
      what I've done  before  is I have a -
    
    
      uh
    
    
      tape recorder, with a reverse button.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      And you just,
    
    
      you know, if it's  word  level
    
    
      e- you know, you do a -
    
    
      e-
    
    
      a r-
    
    
      I just hit the r-
    
    
      re-
    
    
      Play. 
    
    
      the rewind button
    
    
      every couple of words and
    
    
      type  what I know and then -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      and then
    
    
      at the end do a
    
    
      breeze through to be sure that everything's correct. However, they do have software these days which -
    
    
      with a digitized
    
    
      uh record
    
    
      you can have control over replay
    
    
      through some sort of an interface.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Um.
    
    
      I've  never  used one of those. I  know  it would be an -  a    wonderful  idea.
    
    
      It's just
    
    
      I haven't transcribed in -
    
    
      in  awhile. 
    
    
      The  problem  is -
    
    
      I mean -
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      The  nice  thing about  transcribers  is they have  foot  pedals,
    
    
      Foot pedals? I've used transcribing machines.
    
    
      That's fine.
    
    
      um
    
    
      But I frankly
    
    
      didn't find it any more use to me than
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      my  hand-held taperecorder.
    
    
       I  see.
    
    
      However, if we  have  a transcribing machine
    
    
      I would  accept  it.
    
    
      The other thing is,
    
    
      you know,
    
    
      having -
    
    
      getting  hold  of a transcriber. I think that CogSci has one.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      And I could probably borrow one.
    
    
      Well,
    
    
      I - I - I actually  have  one.
    
    
      one th-
    
    
       You  have one  yourself? 
    
    
      Well,  Sarah  has one because she does a lot of
    
    
      Oh, I see! 
    
    
       transcribing  of  interviews. 
    
    
      Oh, super!
    
    
      But
    
    
      The  other  thing is is that we might be -
    
    
      The  crazy  thing is we'd have to
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
       convert  the s-
    
    
      we'd have to  dump  the audio files onto  cassette. 
    
    
      to use it.
    
    
      Oh,  I  see.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      I mean, given that we've already
    
    
      got them  digitally 
    
    
      it would be -
    
    
      you know, it's quite  tempting  to use some kind of uh  software  thing.
    
    
      Oh, O_K.
    
    
      But - but then there's the  question  of the ergonomic  interface,  that -
    
    
      I kn-
    
    
      Oh,
    
    
      I  actually   have  some  foot  pedals for the P_ C. 
    
    
      Well, that's what I was gonna  say,  is
    
    
      that Adam has  foot  pedals that we could  probably  try and  rig  something up to -
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Oh, that'd be  super. 
    
    
      What do they  connect  to?
    
    
      Uh, keyboard.
    
    
      and they generate  keystrokes. 
    
    
      Oh, that's  totally   cool. 
    
    
      now how - how do you -
    
    
      how do you decide which  keystrokes  they generate?
    
    
      Um
    
    
      There's a little  program  that downloads  into  it.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
       This  is great. 
    
    
      Um.
    
    
      And this is  Windows? 
    
    
      But the  program   probably  only runs in Windows, although I bet we could
    
    
      program it  once 
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      And -
    
    
      and then put it on  another   machine  and it would  work. 
    
    
      Except for the fact that we would have to unplug it and pow- and
    
    
      I  haven't   used  them.
    
    
      change - it w-
    
    
      Does it lose the memory
    
    
      once you've unpowered it?
    
    
      I don't know.
    
    
      I don't  think  it does.
    
    
      So  hang  on. You have -
    
    
      You  have  these foot pedals but you d- you're not  using  them.
    
    
      I'm not  using  them anymore. I  used  to use them.
    
    
      So they're  currently  set up
    
    
      for  Shift,   Control,  and  Alt. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      But I r- I don't  use  them.  They're not even plugged  in. 
    
    
       Wow. 
    
    
      That's so  cool. 
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      This sounds  wonderful. 
    
    
      And so tha- uh if that would  help,  uh I'm  certainly  willing to  donate  them.
    
    
      Well,
    
    
      I'm - I'm open to -
    
    
      the d- the - well, the uh
    
    
      The part that's  not  wonderful is someone has to  write  the  software.  
    
    
      
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah, that's  true. 
    
    
      
    
    
      And it - it  is  a P_C connection, so it would have to go on a P_ C  somewhere.
    
    
      Well,
    
    
      you know -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Now, we're at a  pilot  phase right now, and  what I was told is that
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      beginning,
    
    
      you know,
    
    
      that the - the pilot data would be something like half hour of uh - or f-
    
    
      you know -
    
    
      half hour to forty minutes of running text.
    
    
      And so,  for the  pilot  thing,
    
    
      you know, of  course  this would be  useful. 
    
    
      Right, this  is  the pilot data.
    
    
      And I w- I wou- I'm assu-
    
    
      I'm  assuming  that I would not be
    
    
      Yeah,  yeah,  you are   generating  it.
    
    
      uh
    
    
      you know
    
    
      e- eh uh
    
    
      transcribing  all  of it.
    
    
       
    
    
      So,
    
    
      Well, that - that was part of the  question,  is that if,
    
    
      
    
    
      for -
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      if we're doing this  regularly  - Imagine we're doing a couple of hours a week of  transcripts 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      um, of  recording, 
    
    
      uh, I  wouldn't  expect you to do it  all. 
    
    
      No.
    
    
      No, no.
    
    
      
    
    
      So the question is do you know of  resources  that we could  use. 
    
    
      So are there  grad  students or  undergrads  or just
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      Mm-hmm, yeah, O_K, so now I've -
    
    
      commercial services?
    
    
      I've been involved with some of that.
    
    
      At - at CogSci,
    
    
      um -
    
    
      So,  Susan   E-
    
    
      Susan Ervin-Tripp,
    
    
      who you know
    
    
      um would typically, and I've done this too, supervise undergrads
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      to
    
    
      do this kind of thing
    
    
      and they c-
    
    
      you know,
    
    
      you can give  them   like -
    
    
      if you give  them   a little bit of instruction and -
    
    
      and make it  interesting  for  them  
    
    
      they can do it as a two ninety-eight or s-
    
    
      or,  not  two ninety-eight, what is it, one- whatever,
    
    
      undergraduate research credit.
    
    
      Because what you do is, you can -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Oh, really?
    
    
      So we  only  have to give them  credits, 
    
    
      you know, build it into some sort of a -
    
    
      We  don't  have to give them  money? 
    
    
      Well uh, you have to be sure you give them compensation for - you know.
    
    
      Oh, you  do  have to pay them.
    
    
      of some - of  some  sort. What I mean is it's not necessarily  monetary. 
    
    
       Awesome .
    
    
      But if they feel like they're getting something  out  of it,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      sometimes you can do it  that  way.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      And otherwise, as part of a grant,
    
    
      you can -
    
    
      you can do it.
    
    
      some sort of
    
    
      minimal
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      wage.
    
    
      Well, we - we need to -
    
    
       We  need to find out how much that will cost, so I can  pass  that on to Morgan,
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      cuz right now we have almost no money.
    
    
      Yeah, O_K.
    
    
      So - so the  cheaper  we can do it, the  better. 
    
    
      Well, -
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Well, you  also  want to get  quality. 
    
    
      I mean,  someone's  going to have to pass through -
    
    
      Yeah, absolutely.
    
    
      Either a  higher  level person will have to pass through, or you have to be sure you get
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      good quality
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      to  begin  with.
    
    
      But um,
    
    
      yeah, that's quite -
    
    
      you know - we've -
    
    
      That's been
    
    
      done.
    
    
      I can ask Susan Ervin-Tripp
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      what she would recommend on that. She's really -
    
    
      She's done -
    
    
      Of the people that I know, she's the one who's supervised the most of those things locally.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      What's her name?
    
    
      Uh
    
    
      uh Doctor Susan Ervin-Tripp.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      faculty member in Psychology, recently retired,
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      So -
    
    
      and very well known in discourse analysis.
    
    
      Oh,  O_K . So, the p-
    
    
      I mean, what I'm
    
    
       hearing  is that
    
    
      the
    
    
       problem  of starting off with some recordings and trying to get word transcripts
    
    
      is kind of -
    
    
      I mean, it's not a - it's not an unfamiliar problem.
    
    
      So that -
    
    
      Oh, it's  very  common.
    
    
      So that I mean that basically,
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      there are  standard  solutions and we should just adopt -
    
    
       adopt  them and it's going to  cost  however much it's going to  cost, 
    
    
      I mean there's -
    
    
      We're - we're  probably   not  going to have a lot of  flexibility  in
    
    
      bringing  down  the cost cuz probably
    
    
      the low cost solution's already been  established. 
    
    
      And so that's just whatever it is.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      That's
    
    
      how we'll do it.
    
    
      
    
    
      See what I mean?
    
    
      I think there's  always  this question of the  trade-off  between uh
    
    
       paying  more for the first pass,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      and then h-
    
    
      and then  editing  less  later. 
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      or
    
    
      paying  less  the first pass and editing  more  later. So
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Well,
    
    
      whatever they -
    
    
      people who have had to do this -
    
    
      I mean the only thing is
    
    
      I wonder if  our  requirements are  different  from um -
    
    
      I mean there's - than -
    
    
      than what's been done in the past
    
    
      than discourse analyzers
    
    
      because
    
    
      maybe we have different requirements in terms of time align-
    
    
      you know, how much  time   aligned detail we need
    
    
      and uh how much detail in terms of people.
    
    
      Oh,
    
    
      But that's a s-
    
    
      Mm-hmm. O_K.
    
    
      I don- I don't know how much ti- I don't think we  do  need any time aligned detail.
    
    
      I think we just have
    
    
      basically one text file which runs from beginning to end.
    
    
      
    
    
       But. 
    
    
      Well, if - in terms of  transcripts,  sure, but in terms of  speaker  change it might be
    
    
      nice to get the actual
    
    
      time.
    
    
      Sure.
    
    
      But not if it  costs  more. 
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Well, O_K. So what  happened  with  Switchboard 
    
    
      was
    
    
      at least,
    
    
      I mean, the  output 
    
    
      was that they had
    
    
       speaker  turns
    
    
      and they
    
    
      um
    
    
      analyzed it in terms of,
    
    
      you know, " this  is where this speaker change came in"
    
    
      and of course that gets really
    
    
      difficult when you're talking about - I mean, this is some of the stuff that you were
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      talking about in
    
    
      uh
    
    
      your lunch talk, is that - is that
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      you know, you get backchannels and stuff like that, that
    
    
      that,
    
    
      you know, disrupt the
    
    
      um
    
    
      the
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      segment- you know the
    
    
      segmentation.
    
    
       Right,  I mean,
    
    
      the - it's sort of it's - a little -
    
    
      In some sense it's a little bit easier with it - with
    
    
       Switchboard  because the telephone is so -
    
    
      actually people
    
    
      are less flexible in what they do. In this kind of situation where
    
    
      we've got
    
    
      nonverbal
    
    
      channels
    
    
       then  there's a lot of overlap
    
    
      and there's just that it's not a very good model.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Oh,
    
    
      in terms of  data  format, what are we going to  do  about that?
    
    
      I mean,
    
    
      you have the  S_T_  M  format, where you have
    
    
      you know, every  phrase,  every  utterance  is - is
    
    
      a single speaker.
    
    
      I mean, is  that  the  right  way to  do  it? Or -
    
    
      Well,
    
    
      every utterance is a single  speaker,  right?
    
    
      It's just that utterances can  overlap. 
    
    
      I mean,
    
    
      Is that the right way to do it?
    
    
       I  think so.
    
    
      I think - I think - I mean, I think when I'm - when -
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Like, So,  Eric  made a s- made a sentence,
    
    
      and that should be like one
    
    
      utterance
    
    
      and then  I  had a couple of backchannels  in  there
    
    
      and they should be just overlapping  things  that -
    
    
      I don't think that we should  break  Eric's sentences for  those.  I think -
    
    
      O_K. So that means that for each  utterance,  we'll need the time marks,
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      the start and end of each  utterance. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      So.
    
    
      So -
    
    
      Well, we'll have to  go  in from  somewhere 
    
    
      but we can't necessarily -
    
    
      I mean, we - we  may  be able to get the  transcriber  to give them to us
    
    
      if we
    
    
      give them  software 
    
    
      but
    
    
      we may  not 
    
    
      in which case we'll have to get them
    
    
      
    
    
      some  other  way, like with forced alignment  later,  I mean
    
    
      you know all this  can  be  done. 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      So we - maybe we should look at the um -
    
    
      the tools that Mississippi State has.
    
    
       Yeah. 
    
    
      Because, I d- I - I know that they published
    
    
      um
    
    
      i- 
    
    
      annotation tools,
    
    
      Well,  X_Waves  have some as  well,  but they're  pretty  low  level. 
    
    
      you know, for their ins-
    
    
      
    
    
      They're designed for um -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Phoneme - phoneme - phoneme transcriptions. Yeah.
    
    
      for  phoneme-level 
    
    
      
    
    
      I should've -
    
    
      Although, they  actually  have a  nice  tool for -
    
    
      that could be used for  speaker  change  marking.
    
    
      There's a - there are - there's a  whole   bunch  of tools. There's a - some web
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      page, where they have a list of like ten of them or something.
    
    
      Are you speaking about Mississippi State per se? or are y-
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      No, no, no. There's  some  -
    
    
      I mean, I just - there are - there are a lot of
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      a lot of  @@  these things.
    
    
      Actually, I wanted to mention -
    
    
      There are  two  projects, which
    
    
      are
    
    
      international,
    
    
       huge  projects  focused  on this kind of thing,
    
    
      actually.
    
    
      One of them's  MATE, 
    
    
      one of them's  EAGLES. 
    
    
      and um.
    
    
      Oh,  EAGLES. 
    
    
      Yeah, that's the  European  one.
    
    
      And  both  of them have -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      You know, I saw- I know you know about the big book.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I think you got it as a  prize  or something. 
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Got a surprise. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      And um
    
    
      and they have
    
    
      you know, a  lot  of -
    
    
      and
    
    
      MATE is a project which is
    
    
      being run out of  Denmark 
    
    
      and
    
    
      um
    
    
      they have a lot uh -
    
    
      big
    
    
      uh,
    
    
      e- you know,
    
    
      they're trying to set up a -
    
    
      a  work  bench or something or other. And they have a whole bunch of tools that are associated with them.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      So, I mean, there  are  things that
    
    
      in terms of like the  time  alignment issue
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      I mean,   you  guys are more expert on  that, 
    
    
       I mean ,
    
    
      than I am,
    
    
      but I want to say that
    
    
      I know for a  fact,  I keep running  across  these,
    
    
      and  those  would be  my  first two choices of looking at.
    
    
      EAGLES and MATE.
    
    
      And I  have  the documentation downstairs.
    
    
      I didn't think to bring it.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Ha- Have you  looked  at it  already? 
    
    
      Oh, I have, but I wasn't interested in that particular issue.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      a- a- is this -
    
    
      So, we're talking now,
    
    
      once you have words
    
    
      you know, how do you  time  align it.
    
    
      and that's.
    
    
      Oh. So, these are p-  particularly  for time alignment?
    
    
      Well, these are uh tools -
    
    
      So, MATE and EAGLES are both within the so-called
    
    
      uh Language Engineering branch,
    
    
      and um
    
    
      so they're  intended  for this kind of a
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      comp- compu- s- computer science  application  type of approach. These are not discourse types of tools.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      So.
    
    
      They -
    
    
       Right.  - are they just for time alignment or are they for
    
    
      Can I be excused,
    
    
      transcription as well?
    
    
      and I'll go down and get my stuff?
    
    
      because um I - I do think -
    
    
      You don't -  Just take the thing with you.
    
    
      Th- i-
    
    
      Are  you  serious?
    
    
      It's  wireless.  I mean it won't -
    
    
      Well,
    
    
      I don't know what will  happen,  but  you may as  well. 
    
    
      I - but - but - what uh - I mean,
    
    
      can you spare like a minute or two of a -
    
    
      Sure. Sure. Sure.
    
    
      Sure.
    
    
      Sure.
    
    
      O_K. And I go get my books and I'll be right back.
    
    
      I didn't think of bringing this.
    
    
      Do I need this? I need my keys. 
    
    
      O_K. 
    
    
      Oops!  I need my card key. 
    
    
      My uh-
    
    
      We can hear all your conversations along the way.
    
    
      My s-
    
    
      Yeah, so be just -
    
    
      
    
    
      I'll try not to say, "So, Oh dear,
    
    
      Yeah, don't  talk  to yourself too much. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Boy! That's itching there!" So,
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah,  that's  true. 
    
    
      
    
    
      You  can  leave it behind as well if you  want. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      So,
    
    
        I-
    
    
      For the  digits  -
    
    
      For the d-
    
    
      I assume that these are projects where they do the whole thing, right?
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      So they probably  will  have tools to address the actual
    
    
      Oops.  
    
    
      the - the - the  transcriber  support  and   then  automated alignment of what the transcribers give you, which is, you know,  exactly  the problem we have. So.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Right, but  we  can do automated alignment.  That's  not a problem
    
    
      
    
    
      O_K 
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      I think
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      But then again we don't  have  to do it.
    
    
      
    
    
       and - 
    
    
      Well, I'm not  sure  if we can do automated alignment or  not. 
    
    
      I mean,
    
    
      e- especially in e- with  speaker  change in a meeting like this, where we're  overlapping  so much, I don't think we're gonna have a -
    
    
      I th-
    
    
      a  prayer. 
    
    
      Oh  sure,  we are. We've got individual  microphones. 
    
    
      Well, to get -
    
    
      to get the r- to get the actual transcript, I think
    
    
      we'll do O_K because of -
    
    
      
    
    
      because of the separate channels.
    
    
      Oh,  that's  true. Right. We could just do it through  these. 
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I hadn't even  thought  about that.  Sure. 
    
    
      Um.
    
    
      In terms of  data  formats, uh
    
    
      what I  did  for the  Digits  stuff was just
    
    
      to  hand-rolled  my  own. 
    
    
       That  looks like this  form. 
    
    
      You know, it's  just  uh  something  that's  easy  to  parse  in  Perl. 
    
    
      Um.
    
    
       Probably  for
    
    
      the  full  one, we'll want to do  something   like  S_T_ M. 
    
    
      I mean, some format that our tools already  work  with.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Well,
    
    
      Yes,
    
    
      although that might 
    
    
      presumably we'll have one -
    
    
      we'll have  several  formats that you can interconvert between.
    
    
      When we want to do recognition we'll do S_T_M, but
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah, presumably.
    
    
      if we're -
    
    
      rather than - rather than designing our own format,
    
    
      we'll just take whatever
    
    
      comes out of the tools that we can find to use, I think.
    
    
      Yeah, I guess that's true.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I - I - I've got  no   idea 
    
    
      Right.
    
    
       what  that'll  look  like.
    
    
      but
    
    
      Well I  know  that -
    
    
       on our speaker phones. 
    
    
      I know that  um  
    
    
      the Mississippi State tools, at least th- what the produce
    
    
      does  not  come out in S_T_M format.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      They - they basically give
    
    
      
    
    
      um
    
    
      They subdivide into WAVE files
    
    
      and then they give -
    
    
      for each, they give a one -
    
    
      oh, you know,
    
    
      a WAVE file that g- indicates where the start and stop times are,
    
    
      
    
    
      Mmm-hmm.
    
    
      and then -
    
    
      
    
    
      um
    
    
      and then give the
    
    
      uh
    
    
      whatever -
    
    
      the
    
    
       sentence  information.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      But
    
    
      I mean
    
    
      Ni- i-
    
    
      i- i- it -
    
    
      as you said, it was easy to convert
    
    
      back and forth between
    
    
      um
    
    
      
    
    
      that file and S_T_M format,
    
    
      in fact what I did is I took the Mississippi State data,
    
    
      and just made S_T_M files out of it.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Good.
    
    
      O_K. "MATE  Mark-up  Framework".  O_K?
    
    
       Right. 
    
    
      " Specification   of uh Coding workbench",
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      That's one o- thing, and then, back in here
    
    
      Oh,  no!  It has the word "X_M_ L " in it!
    
    
      Oh, good. 
    
    
      It must be - It must be  fundable  then.
    
    
      "K_C_M file formats", 
    
    
      Oh, looks like -
    
    
      This is the
    
    
      Looks like uh  work  packages.
    
    
      Must be  a European  project.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Oh, yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, it is European. Both of these are Eur- European,
    
    
      
    
    
      but they have
    
    
      you know, American contributions, and stuff.
    
    
      Oh, so  they're  using the Alembic
    
    
       Workbench,  from Mitre.
    
    
      Alembic?
    
    
      I  guess. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Is that free?
    
    
      I don't know.
    
    
      Well i- but you see they have a whole bunch of things.
    
    
      What they're doing is trying to bring together -
    
    
      and they rate things. I wasn't focused on that so I didn't -
    
    
      Let me show y-
    
    
      Have you seen this one, Dan?
    
    
      No.
    
    
      And I'll try to get one for you, too. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh, you've  got  one.
    
    
      What are you looking at here?
    
    
      He's got the  Mark-up  Framework.
    
    
      Oh, yeah.
    
    
      Different coding schemes.
    
    
      But it doesn't have enough  pictures. 
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      So, I think
    
    
      it will require too much  reading  to understand whether this is anything
    
    
      Oh,
    
    
      this is,
    
    
      I see.
    
    
      They're reviewing, and -
    
    
      that we can easily use.
    
    
      What they're doing is they're comp- comparing all these existing things that have been submitted and
    
    
      I see.
    
    
      And it includes, this one includes the T_E_I and
    
    
      uh
    
    
      so it's - it's um
    
    
      pretty broad-based.
    
    
      These things  do  seem to be -
    
    
      "T_E_I" is - ? 
    
    
      Mitre,
    
    
      That's the Text Encoding Initiative.
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      That's a way of marking- mark-up.
    
    
      so, you know, but  focus  on   tools  to  do  this stuff
    
    
      um, I do have a file also in addition to those things, but
    
    
      it'll take me just a second here
    
    
      Well, I  guess  X_M_L
    
    
      makes  some  amount of  sense.   I'm  not actually  familiar  with it but
    
    
      it seems to be the sort of thing
    
    
      that this would be  good  for.
    
    
      But -
    
    
      Well, yeah, I mean, if you  start  with a -
    
    
      a basic transcription
    
    
      and a good  filter. 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      You can -
    
    
      I mean, that's
    
    
      sort of  my  feeling about it, that you should be -
    
    
      you should be able to   translate   between 
    
    
      an X_M_L and non-X_M_L version cuz most -
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      at  least,  you know, with a focus on  discourse,   mostly. 
    
    
      Oh! I wanted to m-
    
    
      This -  this  approach  here  - This is Uli Heid from  Stuttgart  -
    
    
      is um a query language for research in phonetics where he
    
    
      wants to build in ToBI tags and - so you can
    
    
      determine
    
    
      um - I wanted to mention  this  to  you.   I was
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      going to come by and ask you about this.
    
    
      Do you know about the Stuttgart um people?
    
    
      Because  he's  saying if you  represent  -
    
    
      I  don't   think  so.
    
    
      He says that uh in German
    
    
      "selbst" is used in two different ways so you have
    
    
      It either means uh "himself" or it means " even "
    
    
      and you can tell the difference in terms of uh  intonation. 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      So,
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      they have the recordings such that they
    
    
      can  locate  things  uh
    
    
      with - by searching
    
    
      for
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      part of speech and also
    
    
       intonational   tags.
    
    
      
    
    
       Anyway,   that's   that. 
    
    
      Because the transcriber's put in intonational tags?
    
    
      This is true.
    
    
      This is true.
    
    
      Which of course is another issue.
    
    
      Or maybe not.
    
    
      Exactly so.
    
    
      and then -
    
    
      I have  one  more thing I need to find.
    
    
       Well. 
    
    
      But  that  kind of thing
    
    
      And then I'll be -
    
    
      I think we would probably want to  extract   automatically. 
    
    
      I mean,
    
    
      e- this is,
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      the - this is a conversation that we should have with Liz.
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      Oh.  O_K.
    
    
      Right,
    
    
      I think, because she's going to be -
    
    
       She's  going to be the one who's the most
    
    
      concerned about
    
    
      this kind of thing.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      And  so    she  may have some ideas.
    
    
      on - on that particular issue.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Right, but it's - I think for the  initial  task,
    
    
      Yeah. I w- I -
    
    
      just getting the word transcripts and  speaker  change
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      is  highest  on  my  list.
    
    
      Well that's what Morgan mentioned to me, too. I mean, if - in terms of
    
    
      So.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      the t- the  type   -
    
    
      But you asked me about uh
    
    
       tools  and things and um
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      There's  this  one
    
    
      um
    
    
      This is called " Transcriber ".
    
    
      um
    
    
      "binary distribution for -  for
    
    
      uh
    
    
      Linux and Solaris and
    
    
      S_G_I and  Windows ".
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      "Transcriber is a tool for assisting creation of  speech  corpora." 
    
    
      Who's it from?
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      "It allows
    
    
      to manually segment, label and transcribe  speech  signals"
    
    
      Is it the French one?
    
    
      And,
    
    
      uh, let's see, where did I get this? I got this from U_Penn.
    
    
      U_Penn.
    
    
      I  think  that I've  heard  of this one. It was the one that Steve  Renals 
    
    
      But -
    
    
      mentioned.
    
    
      It  is  possible.
    
    
      It could be French. I can't really tell.
    
    
      Well I  think  that uh -
    
    
      Can I see that?
    
    
      It  sounds  like you're at least a  little  familiar with these  tools,  Jane, so
    
    
      
    
    
      Are y- Do you feel comfortable just  picking  one?
    
    
      
    
    
      Um, because -
    
    
      I've never used  any  of them.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      And so um I think it would be something that we should work
    
    
      uh  together  with, in terms of
    
    
      Sure.
    
    
      uh
    
    
      seeing how this -
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Here's  another  thing I got.
    
    
      Oh, so this'd - this w- is
    
    
       probably  what the L_D_ C  uses. I mean they do a lot of  transcription  at the L_D_ C. 
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
       I  could ask my  contacts  at the L_D_C what -
    
    
      what it  is  they actually  use. 
    
    
      Oh!  Good  idea.
    
    
      I mean, I know,
    
    
      
    
    
      I mean
    
    
       Great  idea.
    
    
      I've got -
    
    
      I've got contacts up there, so.
    
    
      Signed language is interesting.
    
    
       Excellent  idea. 
    
    
      So.
    
    
      "Automatic annotation of prosody in  Verbmobil. " 
    
    
      Can I see?
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      This is the  other  think that  um - This is part of EAGLES, but
    
    
      um,
    
    
      but here again, it's focusing on representation rather than the tools to do this.
    
    
       Why  do I feel like I'm  whispering? 
    
    
      Well, so,  how  should we  proceed  on  picking  a  tool? 
    
    
      Jane, do you want to   pick  a  few  and we'll  download  them and
    
    
       try  them  out? 
    
    
      Is that the right thing to do?
    
    
      Oh!
    
    
      I think that would be  lovely. 
    
    
      Now, so, are we talking about
    
    
      the stage of -
    
    
      uh  simply  the  word 
    
    
      stage?
    
    
      or are you talking about tools that would allow the time alignment
    
    
      as well?
    
    
      No, we're not going to do time alignment.
    
    
      No.
    
    
       Well - 
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Well,
    
    
      We  are  going to do time alignment.
    
    
      but we'll probably do it  ourselves,  right?
    
    
      So we're not - we're not  concerned  about getting - getting -
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      about buying and - or
    
    
      We're very good at time alignments.
    
    
      bringing  in  tools.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      We're  not  very good but we're
    
    
       proud  of ourselves.
    
    
      Right. O_K.
    
    
      
    
    
      We're very  proud  of our time alignment.
    
    
      Absolutely.
    
    
      Yeah,
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Right, and so -
    
    
      Good.
    
    
      but, in terms of what the  transcriber  needs to do,
    
    
      they're not going to have to do time alignment.
    
    
       Oh  good,   O_K .
    
    
      Except
    
    
      Fine.
    
    
      maybe for word-  speaker  change, but -
    
    
      Right. I mean, it's not a bad - Oh look!
    
    
      It uses Snack!
    
    
      Um. 
    
    
      Uses what?
    
    
      It uses Snack.
    
    
      That's a  T_C_L  audio  thing that I  had some involvement with.
    
    
       O_K , then we'll have to use it.
    
    
      Oh, cool.
    
    
      Very cool.
    
    
      No - no question.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      If I have to use it I'm  sure  - I'm  sure  -
    
    
      It's a T_C_L-based thing. I'm sure it's just  wonderful.
    
    
      Cool.
    
    
      Cool. Yeah. 
    
    
      Yes, T-
    
    
      "Transcriber was developed with the scripting language T_C_L T_K and C_ extensions.  It relies on the Snack sound extension, which allows support for most common audio formats." 
    
    
       Cool. 
    
    
      Boy, the  recognition  on what you just  mumbled  is going to be  really  horrible. 
    
    
      
    
    
       Yeah.  It's the  French  one.
    
    
      Oh,  cool! 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       O_K .
    
    
       There. 
    
    
      There you go. 
    
    
      I mean, no, I - I -
    
    
      I- I love it when they c- 
    
    
      But I've never  downloaded  it. Someone mentioned it to me.
    
    
      And that's probably  why  they mentioned it to me,
    
    
      because they thought I would be  excited 
    
    
      because it's T_C_L-based.
    
    
      Did you see this one?
    
    
       The- ,
    
    
      Did you see this one here? 
    
    
      Oh "Deliverable D_three point one", Oh yeah. 
    
    
      O_K, So, so, it's called " Transcriber " you said?
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
       gacks 
    
    
       Transcriber  
    
    
      Whoa! 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      So it's very interest- I mean,
    
    
      it's interesting that
    
    
      one of the coordinators on that is Mark Liberman
    
    
       @@  
    
    
      from the L_D_C
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Which means that -
    
    
      I don't know what
    
    
      "coordinator" means
    
    
      in - in terms of that.
    
    
      I mean
    
    
       
    
    
      Well, I think -
    
    
      What -
    
    
      what is - what is - what is this web page from?
    
    
      Well, I apparently, -
    
    
      you know, I roam around
    
    
      on - on topics like this
    
    
      Sure.
    
    
      And I think I got this off the U_ Penn 
    
    
      and it does in fact cite a French site, so um
    
    
      they have  some  sort of an arrangement.
    
    
      I see.
    
    
      Well, I  just  wrote down
    
    
      the  French  site and I will check it and try to  download  it
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      And uh see what it  looks  like.
    
    
      Good.
    
    
      You- you  can  access it through um -
    
    
      through the, uh,
    
    
      whatever -
    
    
      I can't remember which
    
    
      aspect of U- of U_Penn I was
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      following, but
    
    
      It  must  have been the L_D_C.
    
    
      I - I - I bet you anything.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, they have a -
    
    
      I vaguely recall that they have a  pages-  uh  tools  page
    
    
      Mm-hmm. O_K.
    
    
       somewhere, 
    
    
      with like
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      lists and lists and lists of uh
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      various and assorted tools.
    
    
      Well there's -
    
    
      They have a special project, as I'm remembering,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      and um, usually it doesn't deal with much that has to do with discourse,
    
    
      but they uh -
    
    
      they show up in
    
    
      resources.
    
    
      So,
    
    
      Um,
    
    
      we'll start with " Transcriber " and if it looks like that's  not  gonna
    
    
       do  what we need,
    
    
       we'll  move on to the Mississippi State and if it doesn't look like  that's  going to work,
    
    
      we'll look at  something    else. 
    
    
      I like that very much, and I- and I like the idea of also doing one that's tied in with
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      these larger corp-  corpus projects. So that, you know, the fact that,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      yeah, it's U_Penn and all that.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Also, I  wanted  to mention just in  passing  that
    
    
      uh  another  thing that we're going to want to start  collecting  is  queries  for the  meetings. 
    
    
      So if  over  the  next  couple of days you find yourself wondering what we  talked  about in the  meeting, 
    
    
       write   down  the sort of  query  you'd like to  make. 
    
    
      Oh,  good   idea. 
    
    
      Do you  understand  what I  mean? 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      It's like the P_D_A thing.
    
    
      So,
    
    
       imagine  that we  had   Meeting  Recorder all  done, 
    
    
      and you  had  one,
    
    
       what  might you do
    
    
       with  it?
    
    
      So,
    
    
      if they  occur  to you.
    
    
      So, like
    
    
      "did the French system use Tcl?"
    
    
      
    
    
      Right.
    
    
       That's a  good  one. 
    
    
      Actually what I would have
    
    
      Send m-
    
    
      come up with was
    
    
      So, if you could just  email  me them.
    
    
      w- w-
    
    
      "What was the web address of that  thing",
    
    
      which we didn't -
    
    
      Yeah, except we didn't  record. 
    
    
      we didn't record that.
    
    
      So.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      It's W_W_W dot E_T_C_A dot F_R. 
    
    
      That's a fine question.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      if anyone wants to know.
    
    
       Wow. 
    
    
      But you could get it through the U_Penn -
    
    
      slash - slash  capital C_T_A  slash, l-  Yeah.
    
    
      s- l-
    
    
      slash lots of other stuff, yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      So this thing, this uh deliverable D_three point one of the MATE
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      project is
    
    
      a review of a lot of different tools.
    
    
      Yes! 
    
    
      Yeah, there you go.
    
    
      They're actually, they seem to be more
    
    
      Exactly.
    
    
      the tool- the main focus of the tools is
    
    
      you've already got a transcription but you're trying to tag the different turns
    
    
      transi- transcriptions with uh
    
    
      discourse roles
    
    
      I see.
    
    
      and things like that.
    
    
      But I mean a lot them are tools that will also do transcription as well.
    
    
      And I could be wrong.
    
    
      Well, my-  my  impression- I - I -
    
    
      I really thought of these resources in the context of you -
    
    
      you asking about
    
    
      time aligning the - you know, What would you need to indicate
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      and were there tools for that because
    
    
      um
    
    
      I suspect that  would  be
    
    
      uh pretty
    
    
      time intensive.
    
    
      I also wanted to say, in terms of like
    
    
      disc-
    
    
      you know, if there are discussions about intonation contours
    
    
      I  do  have
    
    
      a certain amount of  background  in that and I really would be -
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      I'd like to be  involved  in that.
    
    
      No, right, I didn't mean to imply that
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      that we -
    
    
      that - that we shouldn't discuss this  now,  but I'm -
    
    
      I'm just saying that -
    
    
      Oh, not right now, but I mean in the  future.  So at this meeting with Liz
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      I - you know, I mean -
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      I - I  do  -
    
    
      I'd like to -
    
    
      I like that stuff.
    
    
      Sure, sure.
    
    
      So, when is she showing up?
    
    
      Well, 
    
    
      I mean, they're coming in April.
    
    
      April. O_K.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      But,
    
    
      um
    
    
      You know, we - we may or may not
    
    
      talk before then
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      on that.
    
    
      Um.
    
    
      I - I think we won't
    
    
      probably talk until we have more data, I would think.
    
    
      Right?
    
    
      Right, since we have
    
    
       almost   none  right now,
    
    
      let's
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      We need to move  forward  from  there. 
    
    
      But uh,  yeah,   I  guess it's O_ K. 
    
    
      And then, uh
    
    
      there's  also  just the  general  question of  will it handle multiple  channels  or should we just -
    
    
      Dan and I spoke about this  briefly, 
    
    
      do we want to try to  combine  channels somehow
    
    
      to make the transcriber's job  easier? 
    
    
      I was  listening  to some of it and uh
    
    
      like, if you  just   listen  to the  far 
    
    
      P_Z_ M 
    
    
      the person sitting at  this  end of the table you can hardly hear at  all. 
    
    
      on - on the transcript, so there may be -
    
    
      it may be worthwhile to at least
    
    
      try a  little  bit
    
    
      to  combine  the channels.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      I -
    
    
      Uh, the stuff  I  did, I combined pairs of these into stereo pairs, listened to them in  stereo. 
    
    
      And I was very impressed by how
    
    
      Huh. Neat!
    
    
      well you could hear
    
    
      separate speakers, but I haven't -
    
    
      I haven't done very extensive tests.
    
    
      Oh, so,  that  would be
    
    
      interesting as  well  to do that.
    
    
      Oh!
    
    
      Yeah, cuz you'd get
    
    
      you get -
    
    
      you get a certain amount of spatial information.
    
    
      Right!
    
    
      It's not - It's not consistent but it's -
    
    
      Well, I bet if you used
    
    
      Wow.
    
    
      Gives you some
    
    
       this  one -
    
    
      noise -
    
    
      the  two  s- most  separated  P_Z_ Ms  -
    
    
       Well,  maybe, maybe not.
    
    
      Yeah, yeah, you'd get - get wide coverage.
    
    
      Well, you would - you would - sound like you'd have like in this e- big
    
    
      Big ears.
    
    
      Right. Right.
    
    
      
    
    
      But I mean - But you would -  you would - You know, you'd get
    
    
      big head.
    
    
      good -
    
    
      You'd get good  pick  up at both ends of the  table. 
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      So.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      O_K, do we have  anything  else to talk about with  transcribes? 
    
    
      Well, what is - what is the goal?
    
    
      again?
    
    
      
    
    
      We're going to end up with  some  -
    
    
      I mean,  ultimately,  we're going to end up with
    
    
       transcriptions  of these  meetings. 
    
    
      And we'll run a -
    
    
      train a neural net
    
    
      and
    
    
      create a recognizer and
    
    
      do
    
    
      What, and then -
    
    
      Then -
    
    
      information retrieval and -
    
    
      Then we'll be done, huh?
    
    
      Well, that's  my  interest.
    
    
      I mean,  other  people have different  interests,  so.
    
    
      Um.
    
    
      That's what  I  want.
    
    
      Of course, there are different kinds of recos-
    
    
      so we're going to actually train a recognizer based on these
    
    
      uh, far-field mikes  cuz what we - that's the problem we're trying to solve.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      We need a lot of - I mean -
    
    
      Well, what - the -
    
    
      so, the  reason  we're doing near field as  well  is if that doesn't  work  we wanna back-
    
    
      we want some -
    
    
      Well -
    
    
      and also the near field will allow us to do the  time  alignment accurately.
    
    
      something that will work.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Um.
    
    
      So these are near - near field?
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
       there 
    
    
      Yeah. Yeah.  Close mikes.
    
    
      O_K. 
    
    
      I mean I - yeah, I feel like -
    
    
      that - What we're actually going to  do  with these data is
    
    
       very  unclear to me
    
    
      Why?
    
    
      Well, because I  don't  think that's a -
    
    
      Y-
    
    
       That's   not  going to work. Right? O_K. We're going to get  horrible   performance  on that. 
    
    
      The  question  is, "is it - will it work well enough to do  information  retrieval?"
    
    
      
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      So, w- will the application - the Meeting Recorder  application, 
    
    
       work? 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      So,
    
    
      Is -
    
    
       Part  of the  research  is um
    
    
      "is fifty percent
    
    
      accuracy  enough  to do an- useful  information  retrieval?"
    
    
      Well, part-
    
    
      It  might  be.
    
    
      I-
    
    
      Well, we  know  the answer to  that, 
    
    
      but unfortunately,  will  we get fifty percent p- accuracy? 
    
    
      
    
    
      That's right,
    
    
      Well, but you know we have to  try. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      We - we - we could  simply   not   do  the  project. 
    
    
      
    
    
      But I think that's a  bad   solution. 
    
    
      W-
    
    
      We  also  need to d-
    
    
      do this in terms of  SmartKom, 
    
    
      I mean, we're collecting this as -
    
    
      to build general
    
    
      English acoustic models.
    
    
      that
    
    
      can be
    
    
      that they can say "O_K here's the vocabulary and
    
    
      here's the -
    
    
      you know, here are the pronunciations.
    
    
      And go to it."
    
    
      And are they specifically far field
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      mikes?
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       Oh,  I didn't  know  that.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
       
    
    
      You know, if - if we were to add  in  addition, 
    
    
      and I'm  offering  this,
    
    
      um
    
    
      to the  word  level,
    
    
      also
    
    
      the -
    
    
      uh, so,  stressed  words,
    
    
      within
    
    
      utterances
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I  do  think that that would help the information retrieval.
    
    
      Well, I mean, that would be tremendously useful information
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      assuming that we actually
    
    
       pursue  it,
    
    
      but
    
    
      um
    
    
      we've got a  huge  problem, because if we ge- if we want train a recognizer we need  tens  of  hours  of labeled data.
    
    
      Oh, good point.
    
    
      And um
    
    
      it's just eh - it's very frightening.
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      
    
    
      Do you think -
    
    
      So, are - are you familiar with this
    
    
      the MARS- the MARSEC project?
    
    
      uh-uh 
    
    
      
    
    
      Um,
    
    
      So,
    
    
      I'll put this over here, cuz he seems to be the chairman.
    
    
      Um.
    
    
      Who?
    
    
      Who, Eric?
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh, he's  not?  
    
    
      
    
    
      No.
    
    
      He has - he has the open piece of paper.
    
    
      Well
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
       
    
    
      So,
    
    
      open notebook.
    
    
      He - Yeah.
    
    
      Well, he can -
    
    
      y- y-
    
    
      Well, Dan's got an open notebook, too.
    
    
      discuss - discuss among yourselves. 
    
    
      Outrageous!
    
    
       Laying out his  folders.
    
    
      I  have  one but I've carefully  covered  it so that it doesn't -
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      So, this is a project that um 
    
    
       has 
    
    
      time-aligned spoken
    
    
      data which is um -
    
    
      I see it as sort of  in - between 
    
    
      um
    
    
      these  fields 
    
    
      because a lot of the time when people do
    
    
      rich um
    
    
      intonational and - and stress-oriented transcription
    
    
      they
    
    
      don't have the
    
    
      digital
    
    
      record
    
    
      at the same time and the don't have it time-aligned.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      I  don't  know how large this  is,  actually.
    
    
      But I just
    
    
      was sort of thinking that um
    
    
      I'm - I'm - and it's British
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      And you know
    
    
      Well, I  think  to  some  extent with things like
    
    
      So.
    
    
      the  stress  and the other prosodic
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      things an- and  tighter   time  alignments that we can  do 
    
    
      I think
    
    
      we should  probably   do  those
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      but  only  once we have a consumer of that data
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      You know, so  right  now we  have  a  consumer  of
    
    
      the  word  transcripts and the
    
    
       speaker  change.  Me.  I  want  those things to work.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      And so I would  like  to get that done as quickly as  possible. 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      And so,  if -
    
    
      I'm d-
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      if  Liz  or someone  else  wants  to do some work on
    
    
      uh
    
    
       prosody  and on  stress  and so on
    
    
      then
    
    
      we can go  back  to the data and generate the
    
    
      
    
    
      uh the transcripts that we need.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      One thing about that is that is that
    
    
      um
    
    
      in the process of -
    
    
      of
    
    
      doing the word level?
    
    
      it really  is  just as easy to put the stress in at that point.
    
    
      simply the stressed -
    
    
      Even for an undergrad?
    
    
      Oh, oh, well, see
    
    
      in my pilot
    
    
      stuff, so in the half hour or so that I'm doing.
    
    
      I'd just as soon put it in,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      because I  do  think that you'd find that those would be  words  -
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      I mean -
    
    
      You know of course,  Rosaria's 
    
    
      pursuing this - this  area 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      but I  really   do  think
    
    
      from  everything  that  I've  run across that um
    
    
      you -
    
    
      you  should  get  gain 
    
    
      in terms of the
    
    
      uh
    
    
      uh
    
    
      what you were saying, the
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      information retrieval aspects from that.
    
    
      
    
    
      And I wouldn't be too surprised - I mean, it's - it's like uh
    
    
      I mean I don't know how - how reliable  Lea  is,
    
    
      but  if  this idea of islands of - of um
    
    
      for di- whatever they
    
    
      are. r-
    
    
      r- islands of reliability or whatever it is.
    
    
      Accuracy?
    
    
      The stressed w-  stressed  words.
    
    
      Certainty, islands of certainty.
    
    
      Is that it?
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I mean
    
    
      Are you certain?
    
    
      Lea?
    
    
      No.
    
    
      The claim that
    
    
      uh words that get  stressed 
    
    
      are easier to recognize.
    
    
       I  see.
    
    
      So,
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I mean, I -
    
    
      I think it c- there's be sort of a  benefit  with  very   minimal   input. 
    
    
      Cuz when you  listen  to a sentence,
    
    
      you can  tell  -
    
    
      If it's  contrastive  stress you say "Oh! that word was  stressed "
    
    
      and why the heck  not  put it  in  at the  word  level? So -
    
    
      so, I mean,
    
    
      the part that  I'm  doing, I'm really happy to  supply  that without any -
    
    
      cuz it -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      it's just - it's  there. 
    
    
      O_K. If you think it won't slow you down at all.
    
    
      It's not - it doesn't take any thinking.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I'm not going to talk about, you know
    
    
      uh, trying  grade  them in any kind of careful way, but just  indicate  -
    
    
      if th- if there's a
    
    
      prominent word, to indicate it.
    
    
      Sure.
    
    
       Yeah,  that's  great. 
    
    
      All caps.
    
    
      No, well, presumably there's a
    
    
      Whatever.
    
    
      Whatever.
    
    
      an- annotation standard for prefix  characters or something like that. That's what they're using here.
    
    
      People -
    
    
      Yeah, people do different -
    
    
      different ways, a- and so just as long as it's systematic in my view,
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      you can always
    
    
      Yeah, exactly.
    
    
      filter it into
    
    
      some other format. 
    
    
      Exactly.
    
    
      Exactly.
    
    
      Anything else?
    
    
      Well, so, um
    
    
       What  is the plan? We're gonna -
    
    
      I mean,
    
    
      How many -
    
    
      I'm gonna go download "Transcriber" and Jane and I will look at it
    
    
      How many -
    
    
      How many meetings? What about r-
    
    
      our recording schedule?
    
    
      Oh
    
    
      How many meetings are we going to record?
    
    
      Um.
    
    
      Which ones are we going to transcribe?
    
    
      Um.
    
    
       Do we - 
    
    
      Well I  think  the  answer  is we need to  record 
    
    
      as  many  as we  can. 
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Right? I don't see any reason  not  to  try  to record
    
    
      a  meeting  or  two  a week.
    
    
      Absolutely.
    
    
      Um.
    
    
      I mean,  more  if we  can. 
    
    
      And uh
    
    
      so I wanna -
    
    
      um
    
    
      I wanna  start  by in the  next  couple weeks just doing
    
    
      the Speech group
    
    
      until we get to the point where we're  fairly  comfortable with the  hardware  and the  software  and everything  works. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      and then I think I'll - also uh a- Jerry volunteered to have his group do a few.
    
    
      So, I'll uh
    
    
      try to get those as well.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      How many of these do you  have, 
    
    
      these  near  mikes?
    
    
      Five.
    
    
      We have  five  of the  wireless. 
    
    
      Oh, O_K.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      And then we
    
    
      were -
    
    
      going to be  getting  a  bunch  of  wired  ones as  well. 
    
    
      I mean notice that
    
    
      n-
    
    
      Well.
    
    
      your -  you  -  you  stood up and  walked   around.   None  of the  rest  of us have.
    
    
      And so we could have  wired  mikes and I wouldn't be a big deal.
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      Oh,  I  see.
    
    
      for  bigger  meetings.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      I see.
    
    
      So.
    
    
      Interesting.
    
    
      Very interesting.
    
    
      Wow,
    
    
      I'm just really impressed by this, um,
    
    
      yeah.
    
    
      It really makes you feel like you're doing  real   work 
    
    
      when you get all this  hardware. 
    
    
      Well, this is, I mean, compared to the way people
    
    
      normally do, like, discourse stuff? you know, it's like you got your -
    
    
      I mean they've gotten away from w- reel-to-reel tapes, but -
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      and they  do  have  DAT  recorders,
    
    
      I mean you do have -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      but I mean this is just
    
    
      wonderful, the uh
    
    
      added level of
    
    
      yeah, compactness in the
    
    
      If we can  do  anything with it, yeah.
    
    
      channels.
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      I  do  find myself  whispering. 
    
    
      I mean, I suspect -
    
    
      Why? 
    
    
      My  normal  s-.
    
    
      I don't  know  why.
    
    
      I had  noticed  that you were talking quietly, and I was  actually  going to  ask  you.
    
    
      It's bizarre.
    
    
      yeah, this is not really my normal -
    
    
      I was going to  ask  you to speak  up. 
    
    
      pattern.
    
    
      But I didn't want you to feel self- conscious. 
    
    
      I think the problem is that I'm afraid that I'm talking into someone's  ear. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      I  really   do.  So it's - so it's like -
    
    
      And I realize now  that you have volume
    
    
      uh
    
    
      control. But uh
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       I  don't feel like you're
    
    
      speaking
    
    
       unnaturally  quietly.
    
    
      Oh good.
    
    
      I mean -  I feel like it's all
    
    
      O_K. Good.
    
    
      quite normal.
    
    
      Well, I  hear  what you're saying.
    
    
      
    
    
      I'm glad. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Good.
    
    
       Eric's  really got it
    
    
       easy  cuz he's got the  lapel  mike, which is so  unobtrusive. 
    
    
      That's  great. 
    
    
      I  asked  if somebody else  wanted  the lapel mike.
    
    
      Somebody else can take it next time.
    
    
      I've been  trying  to  rotate  it  through.  So,  Dan  will get it  next  time.
    
    
      Are these  more  expensive or  less  expensive than  this  kind?
    
    
      They're  much  more expensive.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      I - I -
    
    
      Which I  don't   understand 
    
    
      but there it is.
    
    
      It would be like the television.
    
    
      effect or something, maybe.
    
    
      Right, it's because
    
    
      they make people feel like television stars.
    
    
      
    
    
      Do you  feel  like a  television   star? 
    
    
      So you can  charge  more for it.
    
    
       That's  probably why I thought he was the  chairman. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, that's  it. 
    
    
      That must be it.
    
    
      That -  that  makes  sense,  right?
    
    
      That's  it! 
    
    
      Cuz he's not  heavily   encumbered  with this -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      N- You should have  run  it  under  your  sweater,  though.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      O_K. Well, I don't mind.
    
    
      Oh, we should read some more  numbers,  then.
    
    
      Are we - are we - are we there?
    
    
      Oh good.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I think we're there.
    
    
      Are we at that point?
    
    
      Good.
    
    
      How much space do we have left?
    
    
      Good.
    
    
      More space than you can -  We've got two hours of space now.
    
    
      uh tons.
    
    
      He - he - he changed the downsampling.
    
    
      Oh  really. 
    
    
      Yeah.
