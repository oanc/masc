      O_K. So, everything's - Oh, the microphone adjustments, we should check - Would you check the microphone adjustments, please?
    
    
      Is - is M- So, is - is Marisa's close enough?
    
    
      Everyone just talk.
    
    
      We - could we look -
    
    
      I'm - Yes.
    
    
      Hmm?
    
    
      But, I mean,  also,  to get the - do - you - you - what you said about - is i- is it close - ?
    
    
      It doesn't really matter.
    
    
      O_K. Alright.
    
    
      Hello.
    
    
      O_K. Thanks.
    
    
      Hello?
    
    
      I can change it. I was just trying a new head position.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      But this w- You know, he's, like, the expert, and I don't know exactly, uh -
    
    
      Hmm. And so, about a thumb and a half, maybe two thumb widths away from your mouth. So that's a little far. And then, right near the corner.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      "Thumb", as in this way.
    
    
       Just - just - So it should be right about there.
    
    
      O_K. I see.
    
    
      Hello? O_K.
    
    
      And then you can look on the screen, and if you see breath noise, in other words, when you're breathing, if you see it going up and down a lot,  then move it a little further away from - from your nose.
    
    
      Hello. 
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      It's interesting. 
    
    
      Hello.  That's good.
    
    
      Hello? Yeah. 
    
    
      O_K.  @@ 
    
    
       Your voice is  so - is so - i- it's like , s- you can see across all the channels when you talk.  It's great.  Thanks very much. Thanks very much. Alright.
    
    
      Hello. O_K. Mine's good.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Hello?
    
    
      So. Uh, welcome back. Thank you for coming.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Um, so, what I thought we'd do today is pick up where we were last time and maybe, uh, go over some -
    
    
      some ideas about, um,
    
    
      
    
    
      well, i- the - return to the conventions, but I also wanted to,
    
    
      uh,  share with you a couple of the
    
    
      things that I've picked up in terms of checking. And these are - uh, th- these are things that came up with the tra- with the Tigerfish transcripts. I'm just doing this cuz I think it's interesting.
    
    
      O_K. So, um,
    
    
      I have an example 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      O_K.   Not sure.  Thank you. 
    
    
      which -
    
    
      Oh, there's -  Hold on.  
    
    
       um,  so there're a couple of examples. I have one in front of you which is the one where, um,
    
    
      um,
    
    
      u-
    
    
      Leah -  Leah  noticed this one where I said something and, um, the
    
    
      transcriber interpreted it as "twosome gruesome, uh, different sizes different this",  and, um, actually what I meant to say was
    
    
      
    
    
      um, "so you're saying groups of different sizes, different size groups?"  Yeah. I- I -
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Whoa.
    
    
      Wow! 
    
    
      It's really enormously far away. Now this - this  could  be one of those cases where the auditory was just really  bad. 
    
    
      
    
    
      That's what I was just thinking, or maybe it was really quiet or something? I don't know.
    
    
      Maybe very - very soft. Maybe with the microphone noise, or something from someone else, or an overlap, or -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      but they're not usually that  bad,  I - I don't think. 
    
    
      Mm-mmm. 
    
    
      Then, um, I have a couple of others. So, there's one, um - So,
    
    
      the person said, "interesting idea", but Tigerfish thought it was, "uh, just an idea". Now that changes the  meaning. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       Right.  
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      It's interesting.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      And then there are various ones like, um,  um, "ish decay" instead of "H_T_K".
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
       Ugh!   
    
    
      And now  this  one -
    
    
      i- "Ish decay"?
    
    
      " Ish  decay". Now "ish" was in  parentheses  -
    
    
      "Ish decay." 
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, what's an "ish"?
    
    
      Well they - they - they were suspicious that wasn't right, but that was the closest they could come. And, you know, with - when you're dealing with acronyms, that's - that's - that shows one of the problems with acronyms. Is that it's clear if you know it, but -
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm. 
    
    
      Wow.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I wonder if that was someone who was -
    
    
      who had an accent, maybe?
    
    
      Always conceivable. I don't remember off hand. I did check the example.
    
    
      And, um,
    
    
      well, and this - this would be consistent. So, uh, it was transcribed as "with H_", but it was really "with age".  Yeah.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Uh-huh. 
    
    
      And, uh, then there are some where actually punctuation
    
    
      changes the meaning. So, this is - the- these are things that Barbara show- uh, found. "Spurts wouldn't be right" was what it  looked  like. But, actually when you listen to it, it would be "Spurts wouldn't be. Right?" 
    
    
       Hmm.
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
       A-
    
    
      That's very subtle.
    
    
      It  is  subtle. And yet, you know, it's like -  And instead of - instead of "and it's"
    
    
      they put "Annette's".
    
    
      Annette's? 
    
    
       Now this - this is interesting because it's like, you know, we know that there's no Annette on any of the meetings we've ever dealt with,
    
    
      
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Right. 
    
    
      but, um, it's,
    
    
      you know, conceivable. And then,
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      um,
    
    
      let's see. There's one other here I thought was interesting.
    
    
      Well this was - O_K, so it should have been "the quals w- the - the quals slides will be fine". 
    
    
      This is Jerry Feldman.
    
    
      And, uh, instead it was transcribed with "the" and then an uncertain syllable "the - the" and then " all  the slides will be fine".
    
    
       Oh.
    
    
      Ah. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Which is interesting. And - and, you know, this was a case where the timebin was off. I wanted to bring an example where th-
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      So " all  the slides" it's w- started too late. It's another case of devoicing at the initial -  Yeah.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      So, I thought that was very interesting.
    
    
       And I think that it shows, um -  these  sorts of things, I was thinking it would be interesting to do an analysis of these things because I think that,
    
    
      um,
    
    
      if - well first of all, there's this overall point that it shows a degree to which, when you listen to speech, and when you're just, in general, listening, probably,
    
    
      but it shows espec- specifically this - to this task, that it's very constructive. You're not going on simply the auditory there's a  huge  contribution from the top-down processing,
    
    
      and the - you know, e- different types. You've got the contextual information, you have syntax, you have
    
    
      
    
    
      your mastery of English, and these various things. But I think these kinds of errors, it just shows the degree which it's not strictly an acoustic
    
    
      task.
    
    
      Oh, yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm. Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      And the  other  thing I think that's interesting is,
    
    
      the types of -
    
    
      the types of confusions that happen,
    
    
      um,  do  preserve certain aspects of the stimulus. So,
    
    
      the  stress  tends to be preserved, you know, the  content  word will be substituted for another content word,
    
    
      and, um,
    
    
      It's - it's not  surprising  that they would hear this. I'm o- I'm often surprised by how -
    
    
      how  plausible  something can be with - without it being correct.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Because it really seems like it's - And then often,
    
    
      you know, i- it's, um, i- there's ex- the parentheses are used, so the person knew it wasn't really a perfect match.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      But, uh.  O_K. Now having said that I'm - I'm impressed by h-
    
    
      how - by how, um -
    
    
      well, how  infrequent  these -
    
    
       these  kinds of extreme cases are. Most of the types of things that I find in checking are much - much more mild. Yeah. So - so. Do you wanna - 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Actually, that comes back to a point.
    
    
      We had talked about this last  week,  where you were interested in "so". 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Saying "so" at the end of something.  And sometimes that would get transcribed as -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      O_K, so, let me just think of an example. Um,
    
    
      O_K, let's say I say, "Well, that would be hard to  do,  so."
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      O_K, right? And the way  I  would transcribe it, I would put that
    
    
      "so that would be hard",
    
    
      comma, "so"
    
    
      at the end. Cuz it's kind of just the end of that - the -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm. Would you put a period after "so"?
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      You would or you wouldn't?
    
    
      "So."
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      Yeah, I would just sort of end it.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      But then sometimes they transcribe it like "So that would be a problem", period,
    
    
      new word, like - capitalized "So".
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Oh, like it's a whole new utterance. Like it's not connected.
    
    
       Right.  And - and it just seems to sotal- totally - that - that's not the  meaning.  And - and it changes the meaning, I think.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
       In a way - So, uh, let me be sure I understand. So,  you're  saying -  s- boy, it's hard to ig- uh, ignoi- that - ignore that word.  Um,
    
    
      Um -
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      So y- the example is, "That would be hard" -
    
    
      Or whatever, yeah, "that would be a problem", whatever. Yeah.
    
    
      "That'd be a problem,"
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      "so."
    
    
      "So."
    
    
      And how does it change the meaning? What's - what are the two different meanings there?
    
    
      It seems like - because if I was just reading that
    
    
      thing, I would say,
    
    
      "So that would be a problem.  So." 
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      You know what I mean? Th- if - if it was like, "period, capital S_O", as opposed to,
    
    
       Oh,  I  see what you're saying!
    
    
      um, "That would be a problem, so." 
    
    
      "That would be a problem.  So." 
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      It - it - 
    
    
      I think the second one where the "so" is all by itself, it's like, "So that would be a problem.  So."  You know, the "so" is like
    
    
      It's like - kind of like introducing -
    
    
       Some-
    
    
      Right, as though it's leading into something else.
    
    
      disconnected from the - Yeah, the first one is - like, the "so" is connected to the sentence, and - "That'd be a problem, so."  You know, it's - but the next one is like
    
    
      Bu - And - yeah.
    
    
      I-
    
    
      not - not connected to "that would be a problem". It's like, "So."  Yeah, less -
    
    
      It's like introducing a new thing that they don't talk about.
    
    
      A new subject.
    
    
      Right, yeah. So -
    
    
      The first one, too, is more like - To me, I don't necessarily put,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      um, like a d- a p- a p-
    
    
      a period after that "so".   I  might actually either put a dash after it depending on whether or not they got unt- interrupted or something, or I would maybe even act as though they were, um, just trailing off.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      So put that - those two dots after it.
    
    
      I do that too. I-
    
    
      Um, uh, which depending on what's going on,
    
    
      like, I'll do that. Cuz to  me  it sounds more like they're trailing off.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Sometimes, though, it  does  sound like they ended a sentence and then I do - like sometimes it's just like, "That'd be hard, so". 
    
    
      Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      You know, and but - and then ofte- often it sounds like they were trying to think of something else to say, but they couldn't really, you know - And then they get interrupted and then I put a dash.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      You know, but I never usually put period and then new word "so" unless it's like, end of the sentence and then, " So. " 
    
    
      
    
    
      "What are we gonna do  now, " but they don't  say  that.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      It's - it's interesting that there are so many cases. And I agree. I th- I think those are very good conventions. I also like w- you know, this - this whole point about how -
    
    
      
    
    
      how that y- th- th- the fact that you're raising this, I - li- I like this example that, um,
    
    
      we have
    
    
      several things that are being cued by intonation,
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      because if -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      if that's a f- nice full falling intonational contour on "that's a problem", "eh, that'll be a problem". 
    
    
      then I would think that there  should  be a period there.
    
    
      Period. Right.
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      And then  especially  if you've got a pause following it, but you don't always -  y-  these things are correlated but they're not perfect.
    
    
      That's another thing, is i- if you're not a native speaker of English you might not pick up, because, uh, you know, every language has different, um, intonation mappings.
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      Yeah. That's always one of the hardest  parts   about the native speakers, is you don't know exactly like how to do the punctuation because their intonation is totally different.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
    
    
      And -
    
    
      
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      You mean  non-native  na- Non-native speakers? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
    
    
      I mean - Non-native speakers is what I meant. Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely.
    
    
      And also if you're a non-native speaker transcribing it, you wouldn't necessarily  kn- uh, kn- understand the conventions of English t- intonation as, you know, intimately as a native speaker might.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      That's true.
    
    
      Right. Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Well, I would  hope  they would have native speaker transcribers
    
    
      transcribing.
    
    
      Ideally, wouldn't that be something. I- ideally it would be nice to have like a Spaniard t- tran- transcribing the - 
    
    
      Oh - y- yeah.
    
    
      Oh, is that what you mean? Or -
    
    
      No, that's not what I meant, but that would be cool.  No, what I meant was that I would hope that, for
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      That'd be nice.
    
    
      meetings in English you would have native speakers  transcribing  it because it - you would have more intuitions about what should be there. Even if you can't fully
    
    
      I agree.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      n- Yeah.
    
    
      understand the word, you can make a guess, you can - that isn't completely off like some of these are, but they're pretty rare -
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      those things, the f-
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
       the really bad mistakes that they make are pretty rare I think, so. 
    
    
      I - I - O_K- So, in terms of like when you're going through the Tigerfish transcripts, you don't find a lot of these kinds of extreme cases?
    
    
      Not this - t- t-
    
    
      Not so much. No.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      I mean -
    
    
      Mmm, not "twosome gruesome". 
    
    
      No, not "twosome gruesome". 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       Sometimes,  but - they tend to be pretty good about  parentheses. 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Good. Good to hear.
    
    
      Yeah. Yeah, sometimes they p- they usually put them in prethen- parentheses, and you think to yourself, "You were  way  off, but at least you knew you were way off." 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah. Yeah. 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Exactly.
    
    
      Yeah. I just wonder, like, what influences  them   to think of "twosome gruesome", like maybe this person just saw a horror movie or something? And,
    
    
      Good.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      uh, this is  the interpretation that came to mind or something?
    
    
      It's - Could be.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      You know what I mean? Like, where would you get the word "gruesome"?
    
    
      I don't know.
    
    
      You know, you just sort of pull it out of the air? Anyway.
    
    
      Well, I mean, you get the "G_R" from "groups", I guess, but
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I don't know where the  rest  of it came from.
    
    
      Uh, "groups of", "gruesome".
    
    
      g- Group. 
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      "Groups of", "gruesome". 
    
    
      You've got the, uh, "S_" in the middle.
    
    
      Yeah. If you - if for some reason they didn't hear the "F_", if they didn't hear the "fuh",  it might just sound like - Yeah, "grou-" uh, "gruesuh".
    
    
      "Gruesome".
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah. It's both labial  at the end.
    
    
      Mmm-hmm. 
    
    
      
    
    
      You know. And then you would kind of have to come up with some sort of consonant and maybe it's an " M_ " to you. 
    
    
      "Groups of" - 
    
    
       
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Well, also -
    
    
      "Group of, groups of, groups  of, group - s-" 
    
    
      "Fff".  Because also, I mean, "F_" is
    
    
      Gruesome  groups of  gruesome  groups of  
    
    
      "Fff".  is, um, 
    
    
      "Fff". 
    
    
      I wonder where the " P_ " went, though?
    
    
      Right. "Fff".  Because it's -
    
    
      Maybe the "P_" wasn't pronounced very well, like "groups of" 
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah?
    
    
      "Pss".   
    
    
      Yeah, because it's, um,
    
    
       bilabial   too. "Fff".  you know, you'll
    
    
      di- uh, or interl- interdental, "fff". 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      you know, it's close enough, I guess, to "mmm",  you know. You're getting the closure of the lips. So maybe that's
    
    
      Nnn, I guess.
    
    
       what they were do-
    
    
      
    
    
      getting. I don't know.
    
    
      It's possible.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Well, you know, there's also this problem that they didn't have context to constrain the interpretation, cuz -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah,  that's  really  hard,  th-
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      to not be able to go and listen to the other channels and figure out the context of what it's occurring in.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, when I'm clearing the par- parentheses, I find that very useful. I - I -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      sometimes I try to just go through and pick up the parentheses, see if I can do it just by itself, but
    
    
      
    
    
      it - it's remarkable how sometimes something can be so totally opaque, and then you go back to, you know, the person's previous utterance or you go to the mixed channel, or you,
    
    
      uh, check on the other things and suddenly it becomes perfectly clear. It's very -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      very surprising.
    
    
      Very surprising. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Good.
    
    
      But this other business, um, that you have at the bottom with people
    
    
      getting transcribed on another channel 
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      Is that what it's about?
    
    
      is, uh - is  much  more common.
    
    
      I wasn't - I couldn't u- I don't know, for some reason that didn't make sense to me. But th- it's about when things are transcribed on other channels than what they're set on? O_K.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      And what's always funny to me is when it's th- you know, they m- mi- miss the gender completely, like, you know, Morgan'll be on Jane's channel, or just something bizarre like that.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Um,
    
    
      
    
    
      so.
    
    
       Well, maybe it's because they don't realize that
    
    
      you're supposed to sp- Do they? I mean, maybe they don't really realize that you're supposed to split it up. Or something like, they maybe think, "Well, I hear it just as clearly - I hear this other person's voice just as clearly and I realize it's not
    
    
      Jane, and I realize it's not a  female  even, but, um, because it's so clear on this  channel, 
    
    
      I'm supposed to do it.
    
    
      I'm supposed to transcribe it."
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
       h-  Yeah. 
    
    
      I - I'd imagine that's p- that might be what that is.
    
    
      They probably don't even know how many people are at the meeting, or w-  anything. 
    
    
      Yeah, it's really a- an odd task in - in a way because they're -
    
    
      they have no clues at all about how dominant the speaker is on the channel they're transcribing.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      And the pre-segmenter doesn't give them any or the information eith- either. I'm - I'm sure that it's because of the -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Wow. We're - we're really  spoiled,  then, with our
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Fancy-schmancy. 
    
    
       interface   here,  right?
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I mean -
    
    
      s- it's
    
    
      very useful.
    
    
      If I was gonna make just a guess, though, from my experience it would seem like the men get mis- um,
    
    
      
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      the men get moved onto other channels, maybe more frequently. And it's just probably cuz they have deeper voices and they're getting picked up on more channels,
    
    
       That would make - that would make some sense.
    
    
      um, than their own channel. Um, for w- you know, it's an  acoustic  thing.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Or they just tend to sp- peak  louder, maybe?
    
    
      That's true. They do - they do say that m- men's voices c- carry better. I mean, that's why they use, like, I think- who was telling me? Ian Maddieson was talking about this, that they use male voices in, um,
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       in, um,
    
    
      airports.
    
    
      Oh!
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Because the acoustics of it - it just fits into the hea- a hearer's range -
    
    
      
    
    
      For announcements and things?
    
    
      Yeah, that's th- It fits into a hearer's range of perception,
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      um, better than a lot of female voices.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      And so that's why they use male voices.  We  were just  talking  about that. 
    
    
      They should do that at BART, too, because
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       I  see.
    
    
      sometimes it's hard to  hear.   
    
    
       And now  they have those strange computerized voices that n- 
    
    
      
    
    
      So-
    
    
      Yeah. Those are - i- a- w- actually probably just the computer problem not the gender problem. 
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
        
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Huh. So - so this means that people with  hearing  problems would hear, uh, uh, one of these announcements
    
    
      better if it were a male voice then.
    
    
      d- Yeah, depending on their auditory, um, capabilities. I mean, if their
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      auditory capabilities, uh, have been, you know, um,
    
    
      squished down  like in a certain place where it would be
    
    
      n- easier for a person with normal, 
    
    
      um, hearing to hear a male's voice, 
    
    
      um, like if - I'm saying if - if they - d- if they had a - some sort of, um,
    
    
      you know, damage to part of their
    
    
      brain that processes auditory information, then - and, i- uh, e- i- u-
    
    
      if that part of the brain normally codes for,
    
    
      you know, male voices, uh, in a normal hearer,  then they might not be able to. You know. Does that make sense? Like if that part is damaged. So, but, um -
    
    
      Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Selective.
    
    
      but yeah, if - I guess for most h-
    
    
      hearers it's just easier. And it's like a certain,
    
    
      uh,  kind  of, like, rough male voice too, kind of graspy -  raspy,  I mean,
    
    
      
    
    
      apparently.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Is  better?  Ah, it's a wider  band  then. Because of - do you think it might be from the - 
    
    
      Is better.
    
    
      Yeah, I guess so.
    
    
       She asked this question last time which was, um, whether
    
    
      our system here, the recording system,
    
    
      may have some of the same channel restr- some sort of s- channel restrictions, such as
    
    
      they ran across when they were looking at telephone,
    
    
      uh, transmissions  at a  certain point. Cuz, you know, telephone transmissions, um, there's some filtering going on. You don't hear the full - the full band of frequencies.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      And, w- uh v-
    
    
      I asked c- a couple of people and they c-
    
    
      answer came back that -
    
    
      It's really interesting.
    
    
      It was intere- an interesting - it's reminded me because of the comment about  noise,  noise being sp- really spreading frequencies across,
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      uh, using frequencies across a broader  spectrum.  So in a way, bandwidth can  increase  with some of these cases of  distortion  that we have.
    
    
      
    
    
       But it's n- it's not
    
    
      
    
    
      a  useful  kind of increase  in frequency range.
    
    
      Right. Yeah. I was just saying  that   it, like, you know, sometimes, um,
    
    
      if - Remember I was saying, like, if there's a discrepancy between fricatives, you know, like, um, "shuh"  or "suh"  will show up in a certain part of the spectrum, and -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      and, uh, oftentimes the "fuh"  is
    
    
      like knocked out of the spectrum by -
    
    
      By filtering or something? 
    
    
      um, by filtering in some of the older phones.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      And that's why, like he-
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      So what was the answer  here?  It - that's  not  the case?
    
    
      Answer?
    
    
      
    
    
      That they don't -
    
    
      That they - that they  don't.  We don't have a reduction
    
    
      Oh, O_K.
    
    
      Y- right.
    
    
       Oh.  
    
    
      in that direction.
    
    
      Good.
    
    
      That, uh, I mean, you know, one  could  have if one had cheaper microphones than we have, but we've got good microphones  and another -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      there is sort of an upper  limit  set on our bandwidth by the  sampling  rate
    
    
      but then that becomes - So Adam's ans- that - then it becomes a matter of, Is that something that would be relevant to perceptual range.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      And, I didn't really have the sense that it would.
    
    
      I didn't get that from him, actually. I felt like, um, he's basically saying that for our - for
    
    
       
    
    
      all intents and purposes with this, it's covering
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      whatever sounds are necessary to be covered, like everything. That's - that's what I th-
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Good. I - I - that was my impression also. It wa- so we don't have that kind of reduction like you have on telephones. And actually in the work that they were doing with
    
    
      the telephone corpora, they did run into limitations and -
    
    
      uh, certain types that they - when - what their speech recognition approach is  because  of the - of the filtering.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      I mean it  does  seem like when  I  hear these things,  except  for the distortion parts,
    
    
      where the volume's too high, or th- of course when the volume's too low, but that's a different problem,
    
    
      um, except for those cases, it seems to me that
    
    
      it really is as if the person were speaking in my ear. I don't feel that it's being reduced in any way.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah, that's what it seems like.
    
    
      Yeah. Yeah, I do too.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah?
    
    
      And he was saying in the - in the, uh, areas where you have clipping, where it's recorded too high, and - and it  starts to saturate and you have trouble, um -
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      I thought that was very interesting. So bandwidth then gets - gets actually wider instead of narrower because you have,
    
    
      um -
    
    
       Uh-oh.  You have these - y- y- you still have - The frequencies are represented but the energy distributions are thrown off,
    
    
      
    
    
      and, um, in fact you have also some additional frequencies. So you end up with a wider bandwidth functionally, I mean -
    
    
      Yeah. So, like, you were saying, like -
    
    
      But not helpful for speech.
    
    
      in the case of something with clipping, does it - were you saying that, uh - it - it increases to - or, expands to  accommodate  that? Or, no?
    
    
       No, technically, the bandwidth is wider
    
    
      than - so it's actually paradoxical in a way cuz you usually think bandwidth - better bandwidth is better.
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      But in the cases of - of distortion than you can end up with,
    
    
      Right. Oh, O_K. Yeah. I see what you're saying.
    
    
      uh,
    
    
      a wider bandwidth which isn't useful in terms of understanding speech.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      So.
    
    
      I have a question.
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      In the -  some of the  earlier  meetings I guess, there was a lot of spikes, or what I called spikes.
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      I was wondering what that
    
    
       is.  I don't even know if it's relevant or useful to know, but I'm just curious.
    
    
      One source was, there was a problem with a connection
    
    
      where the microphone went int- went into a box - I was trying - trying to think of this as prior to - yes, it was prior to the wireless. There was a particular connection which wasn't wireless,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      which was, um, mechanically  bad  in some - some sense, and if it got  touched,  it would s- it would send an impulse,
    
    
      Loose.  Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      i- in al-
    
    
      an uh -
    
    
      an irrelevant non-wanted  artifact.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Cuz those  ones  sometimes were
    
    
      Huh.
    
    
      extraordinarily bad and pai- Yeah.
    
    
      Painful.  Yeah.
    
    
       I agree. Absolutely painful.
    
    
      They were painful.
    
    
      Uh -
    
    
      Exa- I agree. And that's - that's th- you know, I would watch the visual sis- signal to  avoid  that.  It's like -   
    
    
       Oh yeah. And then you see it, and off with the headphones! 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I  do  remember those, actually.
    
    
      Yeah, and like not listen to them. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, you could see it coming and you'd turn the volume down or something.
    
    
      Or just uh s-  -
    
    
      Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember I had  one.  One with that and it was just, al- all the time. Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah. Or, like, skip it entirely.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Oh yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       Especially  if they  also  got  louder    too,    and  they hit it, it was just like "whoahh!"  
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Y- y- yeah.
    
    
      Oh!  
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah. That's really awful. You've noticed that those have gotten better over the intervening - ?  Good.
    
    
      Oh yeah. Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      Yes. Absolutely.
    
    
      
    
    
      But sometimes you'll see like
    
    
      something coming up like, "Uh-oh. Someone's gonna cough really loudly", and I could  tell  because of the way it looks! Or "someone's about to  laugh  really loudly",
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      And so you turn it down?
    
    
       Oh. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
    
    
      um - yeah, and then you're just sort- you've got like - you know  - you're sort of like  - Yeah. So unless there's gonna be some  speech  in there, I don't think I need to listen that carefully.
    
    
      Mm-hmm. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Take one off, or something. 
    
    
      No, a- I think -
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I think that's really important.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, I think that's really important because I generally have the volume turned up
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      So.
    
    
      to  above  normal volume just so I can hear more clearly, and if it's like that for someone screeching into the microphone than it would be really painful.
    
    
      Mm-hmm. Yeah.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Right. 
    
    
      You could h- really hurt your ears. Yeah.
    
    
      I think you could, yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      I think so too. Yeah, I -
    
    
      Oh, yeah. So.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
       Yeah, that's  -
    
    
      Especially - we have really good headphones, like -
    
    
      when I realized -
    
    
      yeah, when I realized, I - I meant to tell  everyone  to watch that visual signal cuz that's -
    
    
      
    
    
      that's saved me a bunch of times.
    
    
      Gives some good clues, yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, I mean, it's very useful in like  all  senses cuz -
    
    
      Oh yeah. Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Oh, yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      It's very good.  
    
    
      Sometimes it doesn't pick up backchanneling, though, and so sometimes you have to, um,
    
    
      No.
    
    
      try to listen - there's no visual but -
    
    
      Or, turn up-
    
    
      Yeah, you have to - the resolution, right?  So.
    
    
      Yeah. Or, like -
    
    
      It might be useful to - to talk about the interface for - for a bit, in terms of what it is that you like particularly, and what you don't,
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      and, uh, that kind of thing.
    
    
      You know what  I  would think would be a really n- um, neat feature for the interface?
    
    
      Some sort of backwards tab where it could go backwards without you having to
    
    
      
    
    
      Ooh, interesting.
    
    
      go up and do it manually, and, you know, press the button and "juh-juh-juh-juh-juh-juh-juh".  Cuz if you miss something  and you wanna go back to it, it's such a -
    
    
      
    
    
      T- Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      That's true.
    
    
       such  a hassle. It'd be so nice if there was just some sort of like, you know,
    
    
      uh, opposite of tab that you could hit, that it would just sort of move backwards. There wouldn't even have to be any, um -
    
    
       Hmm. 
    
    
      But it would  play  it backwards  too. 
    
    
      I know. It w- you wouldn't even have to  have  the audio. That's not - I wouldn't - I mean -
    
    
      But just to move back, but not necessarily a whole timebin?
    
    
      Just to jump it back.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       Interesting. 
    
    
      Right, cuz sometimes you'll hear - It'll be in -  right  in the middle of the timebin, and you don't have to listen to the whole  thing  again cuz you've already gotten the  first  part.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Right
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Oh yeah. Yeah.
    
    
      So you just want it to go back,
    
    
      I don't know -
    
    
      Yeah, some -
    
    
      And otherwise you have to drag it.
    
    
      Yeah, some timebins are  humongous,  and
    
    
      Or otherwise, drag it, or like click on it.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      if you  miss  it, you know, you've gotta go back and  find  it, and
    
    
      
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      dragging it and looking for it and you may not be able to see it, even.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      You know?
    
    
      That's true.
    
    
      I think that would be useful.
    
    
      Hmm. Yeah. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Interesting idea. I'll - I'll s- I'll suggest that to the  charer .
    
    
      Yeah, the less you have to click on the mouse, I think the faster you could go.
    
    
      Yeah, because I noticed  I  started feeling like I was getting some sort of carpal tunnel issues.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah, you were having some  wrist  problems and stuff, right?
    
    
      Much better now that I have the keyboard st- tray, but it was -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I think cuz I had my hand in one position  using  it all the time.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      And that I would - it would crack  a lot. It was very weird.
    
    
      Yeah. Ooh!
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      
    
    
       That's  - it's good to be careful about the mousing. You were gonna say?
    
    
      But. 
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      I- s- Oh, yeah. Um, something - Um, maybe I just don't know  how  to do this, but when I wanna expand a timebin  back  
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      or even forward, I'll use the mouse,  the middle -
    
    
       
    
    
      How do you mean "expand"? What do you mean by "expand"?
    
    
      Oh, uh, in terms of, um,
    
    
      if, uh - if it's - it's - if it's cut off, like the beginning of an utterance, I'll move it - move the line back. And I usually just use the mouse.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      O_K. O_K.
    
    
       Oh.  I see what you're saying. 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mmm.  Really?  Oh,  I  do that with the  keyboard.  
    
    
      How do you do that with the keyboard?
    
    
      Well, I would press "tab" and listen to where I wanted it to stop, and then press "return", create a new timebin,
    
    
      I do that with the mouse, yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm. "Return" and then -
    
    
      Oh.  y-
    
    
      and then "shift" - "shift", what is it? "Shift", "backspace" to c- collapse it, yeah.
    
    
      and then "shift" "backspace". That's -  that's  what  I  do, yeah. I do it  all  on the keyboard.
    
    
      Oh, O_K. So you just do it that way. O_K. O_K.
    
    
       Oh. 
    
    
      O_K. To  me  that's takes  longer  than to do it with the  mouse. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       Yeah.
    
    
      Oh. Do you drag - do you drag the line? See, I never - I never  do  that for some reason.
    
    
      Oh really?
    
    
      Because you can just click - y- I just drag the line.
    
    
      I don't do that either.
    
    
      I didn't n- even - even know you  could  do that. 
    
    
      I vary. I - I should - it depends on how much I wanna go back and how certain the boundary is.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Oh yeah, that's true.
    
    
      If I can  see  it - if it's - if I can  see  this thing's coming up and it's just  so  clear, it's that mountain right there, I can tell,
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Right, then I'll drag it. Y-
    
    
      then - yeah, dragging is really f- efficient. But if it's like a  mess  in there, then it helps me to be able to locate it with
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      the actual clicking.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       Right.
    
    
      Mmm. 
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      And then do this - what th- you were just describing.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      But, um -
    
    
      Um, one thing that's gotten me into problems a little bit is having
    
    
      the "shift-backspace" as the collapser. 
    
    
      Ah. Yeah.
    
    
      Because I'll tend to delete things, or go too far, or something, or I'll be holding down "shift" because I wanna type something as a capital, and then end up collapsing the timebins.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Ni-
    
    
      Oh yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yep. Yep, yep, yep.
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      And - and then collapse it. I did that  so  much. 
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      So, it might be better to
    
    
      Oh that's annoying! This - if I were to -
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      use a different keys or something.
    
    
      if I were to add an option, it might be to have an undo for that.
    
    
      Yeah. That  would  be nice.
    
    
      Yeah. Yeah!
    
    
      Oh, that'd be good. That would be good. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Because I have had that happen. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      That would be great. I've erased entire utterances before, accidentally.
    
    
      Or just, I mean -
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, s- Good.
    
    
      
    
    
      but, or just to change the  keys  used, you know, for - for that option.
    
    
      Yeah. I'm rather used to it  now,  though. Yeah.
    
    
      I'm used to it too, but, I mean -
    
    
      
    
    
      But then when you go to type on your keyboard at home, 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.  You're so scared, yeah.
    
    
      do you do this too? I'm  so  scared.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      To - to hold shift down while you're backspacing? 
    
    
      Like I  - I won't hold shift down - 
    
    
       Like - Yeah. 
    
    
      I won't do it. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      You're typing capitals, and you're backspacing, and you're like
    
    
      
    
    
       Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! 
    
    
      
    
    
      " Oh, take the shift off! I'll collapse everything!"  
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      I'm just like, "What am I  doing? " 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      I totally do that now. 
    
    
      I don't think I'm  that  bad, but - 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, yeah. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh yeah, I  do  find that the keyboard is different here than it is even at my s- for my  school  computer and so I'll al- I'll just be -
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      if I was just at school, and I come here, it's just -
    
    
      Oh yeah.
    
    
      or vice versa it's just, uh - it's like
    
    
      Or vice versa, yeah.
    
    
      I'll - I'll reach for one key and it'll do something completely different, and I have to just get used - just get used to it again - Yeah, the backspace is in the wrong place.
    
    
      
    
    
      Uh-huh. 
    
    
      Th- that backspace and the little -
    
    
      and the - th- yeah, that little evil  apostrophe that keeps showing up. "I don't want you!" 
    
    
      The little accent thingy.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah, I do that too. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh yeah, and then I'll keep - I keep caps-locking too cuz the  caps-lock's  in a different spot.
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      Oh, yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       Oh.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      So.
    
    
      How do you get per- I don't know the evil apostrophe. 
    
    
       Um,  yeah, it's one of the backspaces on the keyboards that most of us are probably used to. So you wanna backspace and you get apostrophe, apostrophe, apostrophe, apostrophe. Yeah, t- you're like, "No!"
    
    
      
    
    
      It's just th- right above the  backspace.
    
    
      Th-
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
        Oh,    oh!  
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. 
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      I see.
    
    
      Oh! Yeah, I do that all the  time. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      O_K. So this is the difference between the P_C keyboard and the SUN keyboard? So, like I only have one - I have one versus two of the others. Is that right? So it's -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I think so.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Did it -
    
    
      Right. I - I'm used to it now too.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      I'm actually used to -
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      I'm used to the SUN one, I guess, now.
    
    
      Yeah.   But then, like, I think there's a different keyboard on
    
    
        I  always  forget th- oh, Linguine, than on, um -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      There's -
    
    
      Basmati?
    
    
      No, the other one.
    
    
      Amaretto?
    
    
      Amaretto.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
       I- i-
    
    
      Amaretto has a different one. Linguine is - Basmati have the same.
    
    
      Right. And it's - and I always use - I tend to use Linguine.
    
    
      Right?
    
    
      But the last couple times, like, you've stolen Linguine before I can get to it.   So I go onto Amaretto, which is  fine.  But then like, um, it takes me a good, like, ten minutes to get re-used to that keyboard. And so I keep -
    
    
       Ooh! 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I don't know. You seem very upset about it, so. We - maybe we should trade. 
    
    
       No, it's really O_K. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      But, yeah. I - I - I have noticed that I'll screw some stuff up, like, when I'm trying to get re-adj-
    
    
      S- so which t- I - I've forgotten which one is which. So, which one do you
    
    
      But just the beginning.
    
    
      prefer? Is it - is it the - So, if we had a show of hands, how many people would vote for the SUN keyboard
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      versus the - So let's put it the other way. How many people would  not  vote for the SUN keyboard?
    
    
      Would vote for the other one? The P_C - P_C keyboard?
    
    
      Which is the -
    
    
      The P_C? I would vote for the P_C.
    
    
      The P_C one?
    
    
      The P_C one is the Amaretto one, right?
    
    
      I don't know. I don- I'm not sure. It's the -
    
    
      Yeah. Or no! 
    
    
      Huh.
    
    
      I- I'm not sure which one is which.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       Uh-oh.
    
    
      I just get used to it. So.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah. I mean like, when I first had started working I would have definitely wanted the P_C keyboard, but now I'm - I'm just used to it.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I like the Linguine keyboard.  That's all I know. 
    
    
      
    
    
      The  Linguine   is - O_K.
    
    
      You're  multi-keyb- 
    
    
      I prefer th- I prefer the one on Linguine or Basmati. I don't know what it's called.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      O_K, let's do it that way. So - so if we - if we have a map of the room,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      the one when you first walk in -
    
    
      Is Basmati. 
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      To the left -
    
    
      the one on the left is  that  Basmati? O_K.
    
    
      By the light switch, yeah.
    
    
      I believe that's correct, yeah. Linguine must be the one in the left-hand corner.
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      And -
    
    
      It's the one in - in  that  corner, right? That - that has the P_C -
    
    
      Linguine is the one in the corner.
    
    
      In the c-
    
    
      Yeah, the one in the -
    
    
      And then the f- the far right corner as you walk in?
    
    
      Yeah, r- Yeah, that's - that one's got the - the P_C keyboard, and then the two on those sides have the, um,  SUN  keyboard.
    
    
      Yeah. So, basically, right as you walk in the door, the one straight ahead of you
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      is Amaretto.
    
    
      U- u-
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      And the one to the left of that against the far corner
    
    
      Good.
    
    
      is Linguine.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      And the one close to you is Basmati. O_K. So now, ha- ha- who would've - So,
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      if you have a strong - Now you're  bi-keyboardal    so,
    
    
      Uh, yeah. 
    
    
      s- but - 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       Nice.
    
    
      but, um,
    
    
      who - who would prefer the keyboard on  Linguine? 
    
    
      O_K. We got two votes for Linguine. And who would prefer Amaretto?
    
    
      Amaretto? So we got more - more multi-keyboardal people?
    
    
      
    
    
       Ready. 
    
    
      I just have no preference.
    
    
      Well, that's lovely. Same here? Excellent. O_K, so i-
    
    
      Yeah, it doesn't really matter.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      It just goofs me up for like maybe a minute and then I sorta get used to it.
    
    
      Exactly, exactly.
    
    
      I - I- I could get used to - I could get used to it too.
    
    
      Yeah, I could get used to it too.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      I just am  very  used to -
    
    
      Huh.
    
    
      i- Right.
    
    
      
    
    
      I pr- I see. I - I have experienced this keyboard conflict, and f- with me the things that are confusing are th- where the  control  key is, so I end up
    
    
      I don't know. Cuz I always use it.
    
    
      
    
    
      pressing shifts and control keys whenever I want the other one, whiche- whichever it is.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Oh, that's true.  I  forgot  about that one, yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      Mmm. 
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      I could easily  put  a P_C  keyboard   in  there if anyone had - I - we already have one, I could add ane- another one - we - so, w-
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      you know, maybe - let me know if you want  it -  to have it shifted.
    
    
      I'm -
    
    
      But, um,
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      That's good.
    
    
      Oh, let me see. So, um,  I - I wanted to,
    
    
      um, m- maybe comment a little more on the interface in terms of what aspects of it are helpful in this, and one thing that I've
    
    
      really been  surprised  by is how
    
    
      unique the  shapes  of some of these things are. I know we had this interface for a time when people were doing  marking  of the  numbers, 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      and, um,
    
    
      um,
    
    
      I've forgotten - Someone said that they could recognize a  seven  when they saw it. They could see the - the waveform and - "Oh, it's gonna be a seven."  Becau- 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh wow.
    
    
      Oh yeah. 
    
    
      I - I  remember  recognizing certain numbers. I don- mmm, I don't remember which
    
    
      ones, but I think it was maybe -
    
    
      well, I could recognize when there was a fricative at the beginning of a number for some reason. It was like, a little bit of energy, or some- whatever you call it, and then it grew really big. So like "four" and "five"
    
    
      and "three" all had this same characteristic, and "six"
    
    
      and "seven" o- both had the same characteristics to their - in the beginnings. But "six" and "eight"? 
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      "Eight",  um, I remember
    
    
      tended - that people tended to not pronounce the
    
    
      last "T_".
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      And when they  did,  it was slightly
    
    
      farther away from the rest of the word than you would have es- expected. Same with "six".
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      The "X_", well the "K_S" or whatever, at the end. But -  Yeah.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      That was a -
    
    
      that was really interesting to notice that.
    
    
      Uh,
    
    
      It's a very different  interface,  though. I mean, it seems very
    
    
      Mm-hmm. It  is  different.
    
    
      
    
    
      Well, it w- it would - it had the benefit
    
    
      strange.
    
    
      of it - So, this - this was to handle the digits, uh,  only,  which is what you figure. And, um, did you - I thought you might have done that, Joel. Did you also? So, two people did that, i-
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Nn-nnn.  No.
    
    
      um, I thought.
    
    
      Did  you  do it? I thought so. Good, good. O_K.
    
    
       I  did it a  little. 
    
    
      Just a  little  bit.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, I only did  it  a little bit, too.
    
    
      Yeah, what  happened  to that, you just stopped doing it? Or - ? 
    
    
      Well, I think that we'll bring it back. 
    
    
      Oh, O_K.
    
    
      
    
    
      The - th-
    
    
      This was a different interface entirely?
    
    
      Uh,  Adam  wrote this as - uh, using the same, uh, computer language as Channeltrans is written in,
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      and what it would do is present you with the digit string that the person was  supposed  to have said,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      and then you would  listen  to it, and everyth- the j-
    
    
      there were two parts to the task, one of them was to see if that's what they actually said,
    
    
      and to indicate, you know, in the - i- transcribe errors of it. And then the  other  aspect was to tighten the timebins.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      And those data were actually used in some analyses which showed
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      uh, very - very good results.
    
    
      Good.
    
    
      Oh wow.
    
    
      And so it shows, I mean - it's - it's useful. This is - this is why we do these digits. It's a nice standard task,
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      and you have lots of different voices,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      and it's very clear.  You know what the canani- canonical answer is when a person says a number,
    
    
      um, at least most of the time, you know what number it was they said. So its
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      "ground truth", as they call it, is very clear.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      So. 
    
    
      But i - it was, um, really rather minimal. I mean, I - I  like  that  interface.   Very efficient, and really is, um -
    
    
      I th- think that we'll probably use it for getting the digits refined in terms of their timebins.
    
    
      If I remember correctly, it seemed to be very efficient in the  key  strokes that you used
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      to do certain things. I can't remember what they were, now, but I just remember that it was - once you learned them, it was very
    
    
      neat and concise and, th- like -
    
    
      Excellent.
    
    
      Yeah the hardest thing'd be  finding  them.
    
    
      couple keys that you used.
    
    
      Hmm?
    
    
      Cuz I would get the whole tr- I'd get the whole  transcript  of the  meeting  and you had to  find  them. You'd have to  find  where the  digits  were. 
    
    
       Oh, that's right!
    
    
       Oh wow.
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      And they'd usually be at the  end  somewhere, but you had to fig- figure out where the heck in the meeting to - to  look  for them, so.
    
    
       Oh.
    
    
      That's right.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I  also  think that - wasn't this a stage where  some  of these meetings  hadn't  been  transcribed,  so I don't think you could use a string search, right? I mean, I was trying to remember how that worked.
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      But it was difficult finding them for some reason.
    
    
      Yeah!
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      Well, y- it was  also,  like you -
    
    
      Yeah, the interface was different. I - I - yeah, it was -
    
    
      it was more complicated. But anyway, than what it would be now, so.
    
    
      That's a down side. 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
       Actually, you - you  also  did a different type of transcription i- uh, with res- respect to, um,
    
    
      our  sister  project, the SmartKom project, which involved listening to people
    
    
      who were supposed to be wandering through Germany, and this is s- supposed to be something that would be useful in developing an interface to help them find their way.
    
    
      Oh, right.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      So, um - someone else did that too, I've forgotten who - who  else  did that? Did anybody else here do that?
    
    
      
    
    
        
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      I feel like I did a little
    
    
       checking  or something on that.
    
    
      Actually, I think  you  might have done this also, as I think about it.
    
    
      Yeah. I don't know - I don't remember actually transcribing it, but I remember listening to -
    
    
      Oh. 
    
    
      Mm-hmm. So actually we started with the words and it was a matter then of trying to find the most efficient way to match the words up with the s- with the actual sounds. Cuz they were reading from a script.
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      And then there was some conversation in addition, that - that, um, needed to be transcribed.
    
    
      Mmm. 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      But, um,
    
    
      yeah.
    
    
       One  thing that you learn with this interface right  away  is that if you have really, really, really long utterances, it's extremely inefficient to do  anything.  
    
    
      
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Because you end up -
    
    
      p- p- p-
    
    
      if you try to n-
    
    
      go  up  in the transcript, you end up with this huge -  huge  space of time and things covering several screens and it's just horribly
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
       
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      i- inefficient, so.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       One  thing that I  still  can't figure out with the interface,
    
    
      it does this sometimes but other times it doesn't, 
    
    
      is when you click on -
    
    
      you know, there's a bar above where this sound wave is, that has, um,
    
    
      n- the - it has a little bar of where the meeting is, like in -
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      and it goes along as you're listening to the meeting and then it ends up the end.  And if you click on that bar to
    
    
      the right of that little marker then it moves forward, if you click on the left it moves back. But sometimes it moves two
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      frames  or two screens,  and sometimes it doesn't. 
    
    
      Oh yes. Mm-hmm. I've noticed that.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      I think that's totally dependent w- on how you have the resolution set. So that little tiny thing.
    
    
      Really?
    
    
      And if I increase the resolution so it's spread out a bit more, then I seem to have more control over it.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      But, I don't have -
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Cuz I noticed that a few times it would do it - it would move twice
    
    
      That  kind  of makes sense because - Yeah, i-
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      and then in - n- sometimes i- it  wouldn't,  and maybe i- maybe I had resolution set differently or I s-
    
    
      Cuz, yeah, if the s- the resolution - If it's moving too  slowly  -
    
    
      then, like, if you were to click on some place then it makes sense that it  would  get kind of confused. But if it's moving quickly, 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      seems that it's covering more ground faster, so - I don't know.
    
    
      I'm gonna report that to him, cuz I - I've - I know - that's one of the reasons why, when I
    
    
      uh -
    
    
      suggested to visual scan the record, that I suggested doing it by
    
    
      clicking on the right of the - of that navigation bar you're mentioning.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Or, actually, clicking on the right of the sound wave and then letting it run past the boundary, because I had the same problem.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      That's what I tend to do, is I use a soundwave, but if I'm trying to scan through a long period of what appears to be silence
    
    
      It's -
    
    
      cuz you always know -
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      Yeah, much more - Mm-hmm.
    
    
      sometimes I'll s-
    
    
       ry  and be sc-  try  to  scan  it, but I  can't  because
    
    
      Cuz you end up  missing  entire  frames.   Ye- I was surprised by that. Yeah.
    
    
      it skips. Yeah. So then I end up clicking on the arrow, they have the arrow at the far right, 
    
    
      Yes, O_K. O_K.
    
    
      and so I use that sometimes.
    
    
      So, on the - on that - on that  bar  you were describing. Clicking -
    
    
      Yeah. Mm-hmm. At the far right and far left there's a little arrow that
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      allows you to go like second by second or something, I don't know. Not second by second, but little bit by bit, yeah.
    
    
       I  didn't know about that.
    
    
      Really?
    
    
      So, is this the arrow on the right, it would be  underneath  that little resolution bar?
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      
    
    
      I mean, it's like in that u- cluster up there?
    
    
      Um, it's not on the resolution part. It's where you have -
    
    
      it's where you have the marker of where you are in the meeting. So you have this bar, uh, and then you have a time marker that
    
    
      moves along. Say, you're halfway through the meeting, it's gonna be halfway along the line.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      I have to do something visually.  So, my -
    
    
      I would say you have 
    
    
      the transcript screen,
    
    
      and then you have a bar. I think you're referring to  this  bar, aren't you? And then there's like this little resolution changer.
    
    
      I think - Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah. It's - Yeah.
    
    
      And then down here you have the soundwave, and then something down here, and then you got the cha- the different channels come out.
    
    
      Exactly.
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      So right at the right and left of that -
    
    
      So r- right in here you have this bar that you move and as y- as you go along it - O_K, so, is - Are you saying -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Oh  that!  Yeah.
    
    
      you saying that there's an arrow right here?
    
    
      Yeah!
    
    
      O_K. And then there's an arrow right here?
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      So you can  -
    
    
      Exactly.
    
    
      Oh. Does -
    
    
      That doesn't -
    
    
      I usually just don't  use  that, I think.
    
    
      Yeah, that skips - Oh, is that what you're talking about? If you use that - I've never  used  -
    
    
      Oh. 
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      been able to  use  that cuz it - I s- feel like it skips such huge
    
    
      Maybe we have resolution set totally different. Cuz I noticed when -  Jen  and I have totally different resolutions, cuz hers
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       portions.  Maybe we  do. 
    
    
      
    
    
      I tend to make it move fast.
    
    
      moves  so  much  quicker  than mine,
    
    
      Oh, I d- I - I - Yeah, I wouldn't -
    
    
      which means it's more stretched  out,  right?
    
    
      Right. Right. Right. Right.
    
    
      I wouldn't use that unless I was trying to get to a whole
    
    
      Yeah. I usually have it set to where it has, um,
    
    
      different part of the -
    
    
      Right. That's when I use it too.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      point five second intervals on the numbers.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
       Oh.  That's interesting. I haven't paid attention to the numbers. I sort of like - visually, i-
    
    
      it helps me to have it be separated enough that I could find a new breaking point if I needed it.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah. That's the reason I separate it out.
    
    
      Yeah. I -
    
    
       Right.
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      I do too, but sometimes if it gets too -
    
    
      too - for me too stretched out, um, I'll tend to think that
    
    
      Expanded?
    
    
      there's a break in between
    
    
      a pause inside of a word or something. 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      I don't know.
    
    
      Oh, yes.
    
    
      Because the, uh - the waveform becomes too stretched out.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Right. Because - Yeah.
    
    
      So I prefer it to be a  little  bit tighter, but I'll stretch - I'll stretch it in a particular place if I need to, or something.
    
    
      It's nice to have - Right.
    
    
      A sort of, like, happy medium, so you can make sure that the waveform has its, like, th- g- shape. Yeah.
    
    
      Uh, right. Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Now I know what you're talking about.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      That's kind of interesting, though.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Well, we're coming kind of close to the end of our time here. Um,
    
    
      I  did  ask about dessert and they told me it was ice cream and it doesn't save well, so.  I mean -
    
    
      Oh. 
    
    
      Well if there's any left we can grab it.
    
    
       That's right. 
    
    
      If there was  pie  again, if there was those  tarts  again,
    
    
      Ooh, those were good.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      I'd be like, "Set  us  some-  aside  some there." But -
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, there's some - Those are - those are nice.
    
    
      I'm not a big ice cream fan.
    
    
      Really? Oh.
    
    
      Nah.
    
    
       No ? 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      But I  did  - I was thinking i- you know, it is interesting to me to think about how each - each of us have sampled different meetings, and
    
    
      yet,
    
    
      i- i- it's intriguing to me to think that if I were to describe someone's characteristics in terms of their speech patterns, I bet you,
    
    
      we would all agree on who it - who it was. You know. I think that's so interesting.
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm. 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, it's - it's a statement of speaker style, of course, but.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      And also that we can -
    
    
      I don't know, that we have this shared realm of  knowledge,  kind of, and
    
    
      can laugh about things that other people would not understand whatsoever, or - You know?
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      The little intricacies and idiosyncracies of people's voices and -
    
    
      Yeah. Yeah. I mean, i- it's really cool.
    
    
       Yeah,  or even just about what we were talking about with the  technical  part, you know, the  interface. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      I don't know.
    
    
      Do you have any favorite parts of these meetings? Things that you - I mean, we di- we talked briefly about this last time.
    
    
      When people get really loopy, and start telling lots of
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       Yeah. 
    
    
      jokes, I think.  I enjoy always transcribing those sections.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       Is this - do you think this is usually toward the end of the meeting, or does it vary? Cuz it could -
    
    
      It's - yeah, it   seems   to be more at the end.
    
    
      Eah.  Depends on the  person. 
    
    
       The - the person -   
    
    
       Or  in the beginning, the very beginning.
    
    
      Like -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, in the very beginning. Yeah. 
    
    
      Yeah, yeah. Yeah, they'll be joking around.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Yeah, that's true.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Do you have a  favorite  group that you - that you like? I don't - I don't wanna cause any partisanship here, but - 
    
    
      
    
    
      Wait, a favorite  what? 
    
    
      A - a fav- a favorite t- type of meeting that you like, or, um -
    
    
      Oh, you mean like, eh, meeti- like - like, um,
    
    
      or -
    
    
      Meeting Recorder as opposed to E_D_U as oppo- Like,  those  groups?
    
    
      It - whichever. I- that way or - or a nature of a meeting, or -
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      I prefer ones that are  somewhat  linguistically related, cuz it's more interesting for me.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Yeah. I like those.
    
    
      I don't like the technical ones cuz I don't understand what they're talking about. And so I'm just -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Exactly. And it's f- really hard t- t-
    
    
      Yeah. And I'm sitting there bored cuz I r- I really have no concept of what they're talking about. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      So I'm going "O_K."   "I'm just gonna listen to you."
    
    
       Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
    
    
      M- yeah, the ones that - where they're talking about linguistic things, though, are  great.  I love those. I like those -
    
    
       Yeah.
    
    
      I -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Those are th- E_- would these be the E_D_U meetings? That's what  I  think. Is that true?
    
    
      The ones with Liz, and you.
    
    
      Mm-hmm. Yeah.
    
    
      Oh, really? O_K.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah. You guys do some in the mee- in the Meeting Recorder ones, there's some talk of,
    
    
      D- d- I don't know, discourse stuff. I think it's really fun too to listen to when you give reports on transcription.
    
    
      Oh, I- I'm - really? Oh, I'm glad.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah. Cuz there are always people like,
    
    
      
    
    
      you know, talking bad about the transcribers, and just making fun of u- And so it's really funny, I don't know. It's really funny to listen to.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I li- that's why I like Johno.
    
    
      I've never heard anyone make fun of transcribers. No!
    
    
      You haven't?  It's really funny. 
    
    
      Really? Oh, it's so funny. Yeah.
    
    
      Oh, Johno does a lot of that.
    
    
      When you guys were saying that last week, I was like
    
    
      That's why I like listening to him. He's  always  making fun of transcribers.
    
    
      "Never heard that."
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      It would be a kick - Yeah, in a - uh, in a good-natured way . It would be really fun to have a collage of all these things, like, "Well, the transcribers -" so, "Rer-rer-rer-rer" 
    
    
      Yeah, yeah, yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      and then s- be some  horrible  thing, "The transcriber's gonna have trouble with this. " 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
    
    
      Did you hear the meeting where the guy was doing, um,  clicks  like from African languages? Wasn't that a kick?
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      Oh my.
    
    
      Oh my god! No.
    
    
      No! 
    
    
      
    
    
       I  did that.
    
    
      That was really a kick.
    
    
      
    
    
      And whistles. 
    
    
      
    
    
      He was - it - I - you must have been sittin- There was a meeting where there was this guy, he was making these funky sounds and making funny whistles,
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      and you must have been sitting  next  to him cuz you sort of engaged him in a conversation about it.
    
    
      I was.  Exactly. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Exactly so. Exactly.
    
    
      And he was like, "Yeah, I can make dogs, uh, raise their ears  cuz I can whistle so high."
    
    
      
    
    
      Exactly! 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Wow.
    
    
      And you were like, w- "That's fascinating."  I remember that meeting. I thought it was pretty funny.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
        Yeah. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      I think it's funny when there's little side conversations like that, that happen at the same time too. I think those are interesting.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      And I think it's really cool when people
    
    
      start getting really excited about something or angry about something because then they tend to
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      interrupt each other a lot, and -
    
    
      I don't know. I mean, I remember one where
    
    
      one person, um, was really trying to get something out, really, really desperately, and he kept getting interrupted by like three p- three other people, and he was like,
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      "I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I-"  And it was - I mean it was
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh!  
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      kind of  sad  but it was, like, also really  interesting  to watch,  or to  listen  to.
    
    
      
    
    
      Have - have you noticed that sometimes you have these
    
    
      Both.
    
    
      a - a g- g- greater frequency of speech errors, I think, during times of inter- of overlap which - which is - you can just  tell  a person's m- monitoring at two levels and it's -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      They're like just trying really hard to get it out before they get interrupted or something, and it just n-
    
    
      it's difficult.
    
    
      Right. 
    
    
      falls apart.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I don't know. 
    
    
      I like transcribing  you  cuz you're very polite. 
    
    
      Oh,  thank  you! 
    
    
      
    
    
       No, really. You're always like "Well,  I was just thinking about this, and maybe this might be if -" 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      I - uh, you know.  It's just - it's just kind of cute because everybody's like, "Oh. Well, O_K."
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      And they'll just listen to you, you know. They don't interrupt you, they're just like, "Well, O_K."  It's kind of neat. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      Thank you.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       Hmm. 
    
    
      Let's see. Have you noti- th- one of the things that I found is - is,
    
    
      um, surprisingly difficult these days is to co- is to get certain electronic sounds, to try and  describe  them. Have - I was thinking about that the other day, it was like - it's like,
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      y- y- you know,
    
    
      someone in one of these E_D_U meetings, they have a laptop and they hit the thing and the - and there's an error screen that comes up and it has this "doink"  kind of sound. And it -
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      Right. Right. 
    
    
      What  is  that? It's not a beep.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      It's not a bell.
    
    
      It's not s- it's not a "dong".  It's not a - I mean, you - there're all these words that I could  imagine  and -
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      so, it's like, it's a "tinny kind of electronic sound that comes up when you make an error with your laptop".
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      And that's -  that's not really very helpful. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      I wonder if like Microsoft has a word for it.
    
    
      Now I'm - now I'm just wondering how they're gonna transcribe  you   saying  that.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yes. 
    
    
      Oh.  You mean the voice quality? The - the shift in -
    
    
      
    
    
      The "doink". 
    
    
      
    
    
      Bling.  
    
    
      Yeah.  I know.   No!  
    
    
       Now you did it  again!  
    
    
      Oh, that thing. Oh th- 
    
    
      Stop  torturing  them! 
    
    
      
    
    
      Let's not make things hard on  ourselves  later. 
    
    
      
    
    
      I  know.  
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      Yeah. Well and  then,  you know, there are these  other  things that I think are really interesting, like the vocal changes in character.
    
    
      People shifting into a - kind of a comic voice, or sort of a mock-this or mock-that, you know, the sighing and
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      the, "Oh no!" You know, it's - it's, uh, i- There are lot's of nuances which we -
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      uh, which we use
    
    
      
    
    
      very often.
    
    
      Comic words and things like that. And - Yeah?
    
    
      You know, I-
    
    
      Huh.
    
    
      Sorry. 
    
    
      sorry, to -  I just remembered one thing that really was - you needed - I think it was  you  that pointed out
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      the  problem.  Like you needed to be at the meeting to be able to transcribe correctly, the noise. I think it was Adam was making this really strange noise,
    
    
      and apparently he was pretending -
    
    
      
    
    
       What? 
    
    
      "Eech-eech",  or something.
    
    
      he was like pretending to r- screw something into his head? Was that what it was?
    
    
      "Whee-whee". 
    
    
      s- s-
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yes. It was one of these - it was  this  kind of deal.
    
    
      Oh yeah, I had that one.  Oh yeah.
    
    
      Yeah! Y- yeah!  
    
    
      
    
    
      Yes. Oh, yes. And  he  got to transcribe this  meeting. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, that was fun.
    
    
      And there was all this meta stuff about - Cuz I was giving a report on what the  comments  were, and it was - one of these was  this,  s- so -
    
    
      
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      "Whee-whee".  is what he said.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       And he was going like  this  at the time.  
    
    
      
    
    
       Joel's like, "I am not amused." 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       I don't even wanna, like, try to repeat what he said because I don't wanna put the transcriber through it again.  But they actually had a big list of, like,
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yes, that's right. Let's just - 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      things that people had transcribed and then they were reading one - them one by one and being, like, "What's  this?   This? "  You know, and then doing the sounds, and then, " This  sound must be  this  sound!  This  sound must be  this! " 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Aw!
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      Oh wow.
    
    
      y- I had one like that where they were describing the different f- qualities of "uh-huh" and "uh" and "uah"  and like what "E_H" is versus "U_H" versus "A_H". 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      u- u- I had - yeah, I had one like that too.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Yeah!
    
    
      Oh man. 
    
    
      That was really hard.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       I had  -
    
    
      That's really interesting.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I had one where they were just -
    
    
      they were just, like, talking about each  word,  you know, and they were saying -
    
    
      they were just describing the word over and over again, and just the q- the quotes around the word were driving me crazy. When they - kn- knowing
    
    
      when to put the quotes and when - And then they were talking about like the difference between
    
    
      "uh" when it's "a"  or when it's "uh",  and at some point they were saying it so much,  I  didn't know how to  transcribe  it anymore. I was like, "I don't know if  you're  saying "a" or "uh" anymore".
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       Yeah. 
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       Right. 
    
    
      Oh, yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      You did an excellen- excellent job.
    
    
      That was really - it was like m- transcription, a meta-transcription and meta meta meta.  It's really .
    
    
      Oh, thank you.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       Yeah. 
    
    
       It was fun. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.  Cool! 
    
    
      You know, I'm really interested in this topic. Would it be a problem if we continued a little bit  longer  on this? Or do you need to g- do people need to leave. I don't wanna keep you longer than - Are we O_K?
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-mmm. 
    
    
      I'm fine.
    
    
      I can stay.
    
    
      I don't have to be anywhere until five, so.
    
    
      Sure.
    
    
      Oh, O_K. We won't be that long, I don't think. But - but I really appreciate it.
    
    
      No.
    
    
      Good. 
    
    
      Sure.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      This is just really i- it's so interesting to me, the -
    
    
      the specific experiences of - of having
    
    
      encountered these data in this way.
    
    
      Does, um - Did anybody else wanna say anything about -
    
    
      I mean, just weird things like
    
    
      before -
    
    
      like, I had kind of a weird thing happen, and we'd  talked  about it. It was when I'd first started working on the project I got this discussion where -
    
    
      this was before we had the different  channels,  and, um, Dan Ellis - it was when Dan Ellis was still  here  so it was like kind of early on, right?
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      And, um,
    
    
      he -
    
    
      everyone's talking, and then all of the sudden, you hear
    
    
      Dan talking to someone else and it's different people that you'd never heard before.
    
    
      
    
    
      And - and what he had done, is he had left the room to g-
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      He'd li- and he had brought the microphone with him. And this is without the channelized interface. So you - you have  no  idea. You think everyone's just become schizophrenic or something. And they're  all  like in they're own r-
    
    
      Oh, no.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh my gosh. 
    
    
      Oh man.
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh wow.
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh n- 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      world or something because - Then all of the sudden he's talking about a co- he needs a copy machine. And I don- and I'm just assuming, well he's s- s-
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh g-
    
    
       still  in the  room  and what the heck's he  talking  about? But just sort of just weird things like  that,  and, um - Yeah, he had just left the room and
    
    
      
    
    
      Wow!
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      gone and made a copy and he still had his microphone on, and then you could hear the - the - the r- the women behind the desk talking to him, and just sort of stuff like that.  It was just really bizarre.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      So.
    
    
      That's really funny.
    
    
      Anyway. Just sort of weird things like that.
    
    
      Well, it is - There's another case where I ran across like o- of that type, um, i- when
    
    
      I was sitting here and we were doing - This was like o- one of the first meetings I ever participated in and - and
    
    
      Dan was adjusting something here and Adam was in the next  room,  and,
    
    
      um,  Adam says, "So I'll come in here and check the levels," and - and
    
    
      he  says  something
    
    
      and
    
    
      Dan says, "No". And it sounds like he's saying "no" to Adam, and it was w- if - if - if so, this would have been extremely rude.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      But- but the thing - and - and the reason that it would be rude is because
    
    
      you don't  have  this information from hearing all these equalized  volume  channels,
    
    
      
    
    
      Uh-huh. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      you don't  know  that they're not participating in the same conversation at  all.   It really is  strange. 
    
    
       Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
       Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I- it  lead us  - it ta- if we w-
    
    
      So.
    
    
      It  is  true that this is kind of an artificial and i- um,
    
    
      discourse c- aspect, the  mixed  channel is artificial because we're  boosting  it in order to make everything  audible. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      It's interesting cuz like, um, when I'm working late at night, 
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      But -
    
    
      I actually don't feel so lonely because there's so many voices in my head.  
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      You mean when you  leave  here? When you're somewhere  else? 
    
    
      No, no. While I - while I'm working here, it's like nine o'clock and nobody's here except for me, and I'm like, "You know,
    
    
      No, no. O_K.
    
    
      I don't feel so lonely because there are like eight people talking to me all at once".  I'm like, "Wow". 
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh, yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      How  about  these meetings when - where there  are  like eight speakers i- in one meeting. Are those - What are those like? Are -
    
    
      Takes a long time.
    
    
      They take longer to do.
    
    
      It takes a long time, yeah.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      In a way they're more fun, though.
    
    
      Takes a long time. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      There's just more variety.
    
    
      I - tends - I - you know what I noticed, is it tends to have
    
    
       Sometimes.  
    
    
      a - still, a dominant group of speakers and then there are two or three people generally who don't talk at  all  except to say their digits or something, or who -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Who won't talk. 
    
    
      And to breathe. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      or to breathe and cough and sniff and whatever. Yeah.  Yeah. But I - I think that
    
    
       There'll be lots of breathing.  Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh, god! 
    
    
      Right. 
    
    
      
    
    
      still overall you're gonna have
    
    
      probably three or four or five dominant
    
    
      speakers.
    
    
       One  thing I noticed is that, like, uhhh! -  There was this  one  meeting I was transcribing, there were nine - nine speakers,
    
    
      and by the end of it, I was so entirely sick of listening to the same conversation all over again nine
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       Definitely.
    
    
      times in slow-mo!  I was going nuts. I was like, "I  cannot  take this anymore.  I can't listen to this anymore. Oh my god!"
    
    
      Exactly.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       I  had that same reaction. Absolutely. And sometimes these are meetings I  participated  in. It's- it's like -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
       Mm-hmm.
    
    
      So you've - this is like the  tenth  time for you, then. 
    
    
      
    
    
       That's righ- that's right. 
    
    
      I swear it's like -
    
    
      it's like a bad dream. It's like, "This is - this is keep happ- this keeps happening to me". 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Never changes. I'm gonna check out- outside to make sure that we're O_K with the, um 
    
    
      Oh, O_K.
    
    
      Oh. O_K.
    
    
      Did you guys ever, when - This happened to  me  when I first started transcribing,  cuz I had never really transcribed stuff like this before,  but, um,
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Is it O_K if we stay for another half hour in this room? 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Good, thanks. 
    
    
      I would  leave   here,  and I would go out and do my daily business, and I would hear people speaking to me,  and I would transcribe them in my head!
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh yeah.
    
    
       Oh yeah!  That's fun! 
    
    
      
    
    
       Oh, man.  
    
    
      I'd imagine what I would type.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah! Yeah.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      It went away, like maybe after a couple of weeks, but it was just bizarre.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh really? I  still  do that.
    
    
      I still  do  that. I still do that. Yeah.
    
    
      No, I don't- Yeah. 
    
    
      Really?
    
    
      Occasionally. Like on the bus or something when I'm bored.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yep. Or, like, I'll think -
    
    
      Right. It's something you're not interacting with, you're just listening.
    
    
      Oh. No, for me it was unconscious. It was - I didn't
    
    
      Oh, really?
    
    
      mean for - to be doing it. It would just intru- it was an intrusion. Um, not a te- not a bad intrusion, but
    
    
      Oh, O_K.
    
    
      No, yeah. N- Yeah.
    
    
      Oh, oh.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Oh, that's funny.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      not something I was sort of volitionally sort of -
    
    
      Huh, that's interesting.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      I would also be really aw- aware of w- how  I  was speaking.
    
    
      Yes!
    
    
      Cuz I also tend - Like, we were talking about "so". I  do  that.
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      I'll end utterances with "so" or "and".
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      and it'll just be a trailing off, and I'll think, "Man. I would be such a pain in the butt to transcribe."
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah! 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
       Like I just, uh, I - g- yeah. I'll - I'll do the same thing as you do, and I -
    
    
      Yeah!
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, yeah.
    
    
      I'll listen to somebody and his or her speech will be particularly idios- idiosyncratic,  and
    
    
      I'll go, "Wow, I just - I'm glad I'm not  transcribing  him or her". 
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      I noticed a lot of my speech i-
    
    
      I don't know, I wouldn't call them errors, I guess disfluencies,
    
    
      a lot  more  once - when I started transcribing.
    
    
       I  just noticed - and in ge- people in general, that people
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
       Yeah.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      break up their speech interestingly.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      I'm amazed sometimes that we manage to communicate.
    
    
      Yeah!
    
    
      
    
    
      Actually. 
    
    
      You know?  Cuz people will say just, like, you know, monosyllabic little grunts and squeaks and things, and it  means  something.
    
    
      
    
    
      I think that shows a lot of - I think that shows a lot of how, um,
    
    
      it's not all acoustic. I mean, there's other things involved,  eye contact, body language, gesture, whatever.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
       That  raises a question. Um, do you think that, um, you would have been considerably
    
    
      helped if we had  had  video tapes of these things?
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh sure.
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      I definitely think so.
    
    
      Yep. Mhh. 
    
    
      And I think there would be a lot more interesting data to analyze later on,  personally. 
    
    
      Mmm, well, mm-hmm, mm-hmm that's right, cuz you're  involved  in gesture research. Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      Yeah, cuz then you know exactly what's going on, what the context cues are -
    
    
      And you can really get a feel for the re- interpersonal relationships, 
    
    
      which kind of comes into play, maybe not for speech recognition,  but for other things, maybe?
    
    
       Yeah. 
    
    
      Maybe this is what it's like to be blind.
    
    
      Mmm-hmm. Oh, interesting.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Maybe.
    
    
      
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      Huh.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      No - no visual input at all.
    
    
      Yeah, you just have to rely on your intonation, and other things like that. 
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      
    
    
      And you get so much more  aware  of all of it too.
    
    
      Yeah. Mm-hmm. Maybe.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      That's - 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I know someone who actually recognizes  perfumes  in the elevator.  I mean, there's a - there's a blind man in this - in this building, and - and,
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      um,  Lila  was in the elevator one day. And they hadn't  spoken  yet cuz he just came on the elevator and he says -
    
    
      
    
    
      uh, and then she -  then  she said something and he says,
    
    
      "Y- you sp- you've changed your perfume."  Yeah, it's pretty interesting. Pretty interesting.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh wow.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Huh.
    
    
       That's  pretty amazing.
    
    
       Had  she changed her perfume? Oh, wow.
    
    
      That's neat.
    
    
      Yes, she had.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Huh.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Oof! 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      It's very interesting.
    
    
      Enhanced other senses, I guess. That's really cool.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Hmm. 
    
    
      Have you - I - I've  learned  several things about having been
    
    
      Wi- i- with the close-talking mikes. This is - this is a new experience. Cuz I have of course been involved in - in this  kind  of thing for quite a while, but
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      th- there are  several  things I didn't  realize  you could hear so  reliably,  and - some of these are the things like
    
    
      when the mouth opens and the inbreath and stuff and it - and how  extremely  audible and - and  visual,  I mean, you can see these - the inbreaths and things. It's - that was really surprising to me, that you -
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      That's something you don't hear in normal speech too. In normal conversations,  unless it's  very  dramatic or  very  loud,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      it's that tangible.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      that people click their - Their lips are always making funny noises and -
    
    
      Unless - you're on, uh, talking on the  phone,  and the phone is -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      the levels are funny.  Then  you hear it. So, th- it's kind of like that.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I guess it's also one of these things that u- usually is not meaningful, so we sort of screen it out.
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      u- all these different in- cuz, you know, I mean, we do that all the time with all other - well, lots of  other  aspects of the acoustic signal.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
    
    
      It sounds like it's a nice smooth melody, but  these things are voicing and unvoicing, are tripping in and out, and they don't -
    
    
      The contour is really not  nearly  that neat.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Right. Yeah - well, yeah, most of the time when we're listening to other people's speech, we're just trying to get the  gist.  Not  literally  what people are saying and so,
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      you know, all the "uh" - "uh's" and "um's", and all those different things, we just tune it out, yeah.
    
    
      That's true.
    
    
      We- yeah, we filter all that out. Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      And, uh, it's that top- down  thing again. Just - right? In a way. Just trying to get the, um,
    
    
      Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.
    
    
      you know, what is the p-
    
    
      "what is the point of what this person is trying to communicate?" kind of thing. So.
    
    
      That's right.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Which is a very - it's - that's how I tended -
    
    
      That's right.
    
    
      before studying linguistics anyways and, uh, definitely before doing transcription,  how I tended to look all conversations, and then
    
    
      coming  here  and doing this, you have to look at speech in a totally
    
    
      more intense way. Um.
    
    
      Including, I mean, every little aspect.
    
    
      I - and when I tell people what I  do  here,
    
    
      and tell them, "Yeah, I'm transcribing". And they're - they think I'm like a stenographer or something.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      
    
    
      I'm like, "No, I don't correct the grammar.  I don't erase the "um"'s and "uh"'s, I record all the sighs, and the laughs, and the breaths, and -"
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm. 
    
    
      
    
    
      And they're - I don't know. This is a very different thing than
    
    
      most people
    
    
      can  relate  to, I guess.
    
    
      Or know about. 
    
    
      Mm-hmm. The - I agree.  Another  thing that I think is interesting in these meetings is,
    
    
      
    
    
      certain speakers have a tendency to embed utterances in other embed- uh, in  other  utterances. And, um, you know, it's very  clear  when you see it -
    
    
      when you  hear  it with the intonational markers, but - well, just the  contours,  but
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      the words on the page, it's not at all clear. And there are a couple people who do this in particular. I -  I  would say
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      that it's both - I would say that both Jerry and Morgan do this. And -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      it's  amazing  how  fluent  it is  when you  hear  it,
    
    
      
    
    
      but how very
    
    
       complicated  it is when you see the words. Yeah.
    
    
      Indecipherable. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      And when you think about it, they pick up  exactly  where they left off,
    
    
      
    
    
      even though maybe it's several seconds later, there's no glitch in the syntax or anything. It's -
    
    
      We're pretty amazing
    
    
      
    
    
      machines.
    
    
       Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      Or creatures, whatever.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      That's really cool.
    
    
      Machines.  
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      So, and then of course there are these - these things which I think are  also  nicely represented in the data which are these funny  sounds  people make,
    
    
      which to  some  degree is borrowing from comic talk. So,
    
    
      I notice people going, "Pfft"  you know, if they're trying to
    
    
      say something is done. The  Germans  do this I think in particular.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      And there are others that we use  like  that th- which are sort of semi-conventionalized, but you wouldn't think that you would write  them    down. 
    
    
      Yeah, the one I kn- I kn- get all the time is "tsk" 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh yes! Good example.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      It's - it's, uh - like I don't know how - I just transcribe it as - I say, like, "click" and then I say, "It's like a vocal gesture." Like a shrug or a vocal - some -
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm. 
    
    
      It's like
    
    
      "tisk". 
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      some sort of like, "Well, there it is".
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Or, "That's it." Or something like that, you know.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      That - people do that  one  a lot. And there was one speaker who used to do it  constantly.  And after a  while, 
    
    
      
    
    
      I started getting confused as to whether or not
    
    
      he was, like,
    
    
      just going "tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk" to himself, 
    
    
      or whether he was meaning it in conversat- Sometimes it was really  obvious  that he meant it as some sort of vocal cue.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      But then sometimes it was more ambiguous. Like it was tough to tell,
    
    
      um, because he would just always be clicking. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      This cou- Is this the one that - I mean, it could be the one that we were thinking about.
    
    
      It could be.
    
    
      But I
    
    
      noticed it more as it was obviously
    
    
       not  -
    
    
      because it was always in a g- the one I'm thinking of always came in groups of four or something. 
    
    
      Yes. Uh-huh.
    
    
      And so it wasn't ever like a,
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      um,
    
    
      Oh, O_K.
    
    
      single
    
    
      Yeah, this guy does a lot of single ones.
    
    
      It would be - it would -
    
    
      l-
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Oh, how interesting.
    
    
      Yeah, just kind of, um - And, uh - that's another thing like I - I realize I do that too.
    
    
      I'll ask you who this is later. I don't wanna  cuz 
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      I can't remember the name actually.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      The - the one that I'm thinking of, i- it's a matter of you can tell it's in context where he's looking in his agenda to see, you know, "Do I have time to do this?" and he's
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      calculating it in his mind. So it's sort of li- almost like a stand-in for calculator, kind of thing.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      And i- uh, but it's  signaling.  I'm sure that everybody - I'm sure that other people can hear it. So it's sort of like, "Wait a minute, I'm thinking."
    
    
      Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      But it's not lexicalized. This is not a -
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      That's kind of the impression I got too.
    
    
      i- not in a standard way, it's -
    
    
      Oh. Yeah, that's a different person.
    
    
      O_K. O_K. O_K.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah. O_K, I know who you're talking about. But this is somebody - somebody differ-
    
    
      He must do this in a lot of meetings because I think - you know, I've run across it several times.
    
    
      I don't think  I've  ever heard it.
    
    
      No.
    
    
      
    
    
      No.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      I've heard "". 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Which I just transcribe as "mouth".
    
    
      Heard that one.
    
    
      Oh, I see.
    
    
      I just make a mouth - Cuz I think I had talked to you about this - about what - what did we do - cuz - wha- what was it that I - oh, I was - "Lipsmack"!
    
    
      Huh.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Oh yes.
    
    
      I was marking "lipsmack", and - and  you  said -
    
    
      That's more like the "". 
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      yeah, that's - It's a different noise, but, um, it's what made me think of it, but, um,
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Ah.  
    
    
      
    
    
      The one  you're  talking ab-
    
    
      and - and you said, "Don't  do  "lipsmack", just do - we don't need - it's too specific. Just do "mouth" for all tha- all those noises".
    
    
       Yeah, O_K. Now what I would say - um, it's good to know this. C- what I - what I would say is, um, if it's  communicative  s-
    
    
      Um -
    
    
      beyond just the p-
    
    
      mouth opening and the
    
    
      w- oh, you know, the mechanical aspects that happen when you happen to be about to speak,
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      then I would like to have it - if it's communicative, I'd like to have it preserved.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      a- But if it's just this mechanical stuff, "mouth" is fine.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      The - It seems like the computer science people use "lipsmack" for that.
    
    
      I - Personally,  my  choice -
    
    
      eh, w- we've - we're still deciding on how we're gonna encode it in the final version.
    
    
      But I tend to not like "lipsmack" because I think that that's - could be meaningful and it's a little confusing.
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      People talk about, you know, "Oh gee, that was really good," and then they do a - I'm not gonna do it cuz I don't really  know  how to do lipsmack. But - but it seems like it would be a - a vocal gesture, a definite type of thing.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      It could be.
    
    
       Right. Yeah, th- I was thinking the one that  you  just did, like "tsk". 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      makes me think of the - what people would write as "tsk tsk". 
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      Same here. Yeah. I would too.
    
    
      Yeah. Me too.  
    
    
      You know, like, uh, as though they're like, you know, trying to communicate displeasure.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Oh, right.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      That's true. Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      And so that - Yeah.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      U- i- cu- there's - there's at  least  two or three that I can think of that to me are very different. You know, there's like,
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      you know,  that,  and there's like, um, you know, well, the one I did before that's like "". 
    
    
      I don't know, like, um -
    
    
      Hhh. 
    
    
      I would say "tongue click" for that. But I would also probably put in parentheses it - that I thought it was a vocal gesture. Because I think it's communicative of a certain thing.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I don't know what - I am never sure whether or not to transcribe, um, a difference with, like, "hmm",  you know, and "hmm!".  
    
    
       Like, how do you transcribe "hmm!"?  
    
    
      Oh yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh. Good point. Yes.
    
    
      It's like "humph".
    
    
      I'll put like a -
    
    
      Really good point. Yeah.
    
    
      I'll usually put a - an  exclamation   point  somehow. Like I'll go -
    
    
      I would too. I think it's more emphatic.
    
    
      Yeah?
    
    
      Oh. 
    
    
      Mm-hmm. W- what about pre- transcribing it, um,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      But it - th- it's true that th-  segments  are different too.
    
    
      "H_M_P_H"? What about transcribing it  that  way, like "hmph"?
    
    
      "Hmph."
    
    
      Hmm!
    
    
      Well, now, y- This is a good question. I guess I would say th- you know,  sometimes  we've seen "hmph" in literature meaning in- but it's a s-
    
    
       Oh. 
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      a sigh - a si- uh, sorry. A sound of indignation.
    
    
      So, if it's  meant  as a sound of indignation then I think that would be how I would capture it, with the H_M_P_H thing.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      I usually tend to think that it's a -
    
    
      more of a -
    
    
      Hhh.  not indignation. Something more positive. I don't know exactly wha- how to characterize it, but something more
    
    
       Like - 
    
    
      "Hmm! I hadn't  thought  of that." 
    
    
      a- sort of like a sup- uh, an - uh, an elevated "hmm"? It's like a m- sort of more surprise, or
    
    
      Oh really?
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah. "Hmm." 
    
    
      Yeah. Or -  I - i- I don't know.  Maybe. 
    
    
      Hhh. 
    
    
      engagement?
    
    
      I- yeah. I guess it could have   two  meanings, sort of.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      If it's  surprise  then the exclamation point makes sense, too.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      And then there's the  other  kind which sounds similar, but it's really part of a laugh. So, "Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm". 
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah. Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Which is -
    
    
      I would just say "laugh" for that.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Laugh. Right.
    
    
      Yeah, once,  Adam  was  laughing,  and it was actually  written   out 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
       phonetically,  and I  changed  it. I'm like "it's just laughing".
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Good.
    
    
      
    
    
      Well done. Well done.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Like somebody had written, like
    
    
      "hyuh-hyuh" or - or - or something. And - 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      I've run across that also. And - Right. Change it to "laugh". Well done.
    
    
      That's funny. 
    
    
      Yeah, i- I - it was maybe  Tigerfish  had done something like they had written out a phonetic laugh, and they didn't  do  it at any other place in the transcript. It was just that one spot.
    
    
      Yeah, yeah.
    
    
      That's interesting.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      That's interesting.
    
    
      
    
    
      I ran across a couple "ho"'s occ-
    
    
      I've seen "ho"'s and - 
    
    
      It was just a regular old vanilla laugh, you know. It wasn't anything special.
    
    
      "Ho-ho-ho"? Oh, that is  too  much fun. 
    
    
      and "heh".  Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, that's right. W- we -
    
    
      I noticed, i- m- as far as problems with  laughs,  is that a lot of them were marked as  breaths. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Because a lot of people,
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      I think we already talked about this last time, but -
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      but not so much as, I never saw that written out phonetically, or whatever.
    
    
      Well i-
    
    
      Well -
    
    
      well,  here's  a  question,  and there's been some variance in  transcripts  that I've  looked  at.
    
    
      
    
    
      When - O_K. So when you  laugh,  you're exhaling all this air, and so you need to i-  inhale, 
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      Yes. 
    
    
      and - so how do you transcribe the  inhale?  Some people are transcribing it as a  breath. 
    
    
      I- I  used  to,
    
    
      you know, back in the  day  - back when I was do- transcribing, I would do the whole  thing  as a  laugh   because to me the breath is part of the laugh.
    
    
      Yeah? Yeah, yeah, yeah?
    
    
      Yeah, that's what I used to do too.
    
    
      Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.
    
    
      I agree with you. That's - that's what  I  prefer.
    
    
      Oh yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Um, so - cuz i- cuz in the ones I've been che- the one I've been  checking  actually right  now,  that  breath  gets marked as a  breath,  and I've been  taking  them  out. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      So you would have like "lef-
    
    
      Good.
    
    
      Well done.
    
    
      So that's O_K?
    
    
      Well done.
    
    
      laugh, breath, laugh" 
    
    
      Actually, it'd be a "laugh" and then two dots, like the next bin will be empty, and then it'll be "breath".
    
    
      transcribed?
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Oh, I've - Yeah. O_K. I see what you're saying.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
       s- Yeah. I was gonna say, I put -
    
    
      And so it'll be that -
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      it'll be three d-
    
    
      sort of separate units as opposed to - I think it's sort of one coherent thing. So.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      I put "breath-laugh" in the brackets when I don't know whether it's a breath or a  laugh,  which is what - I remember you telling me to do that.
    
    
      That's good. That's good.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Oh, well, yeah, that's -  that's  a different  thing. 
    
    
      That's right.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mmm. O_K.
    
    
      Yeah. S- cuz sometimes it's
    
    
      That's good.
    
    
      not clear. Like sometimes "Hhh!" is a laugh. 
    
    
      Sometimes it's hard to tell.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      That's right. And -
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Um, and if other people are laughing, then I'll usually give them - and say that they're laughing.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      I agree with you. And - and I think that's important because we're capturing then the  communicative  level.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm. Exactly.
    
    
      Yeah. Exactly.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      And it's  likely  that it has a different contour than most  breaths  as well.
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      Because it's sort of expulsive and - and, uh, that kind of thing. Ex- exactly. Exactly. Well done.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      A lot of people go,
    
    
      So.
    
    
      "". 
    
    
      Yes they do. Yeah, the  shyer  ones sometimes will laugh i- with the breath-laugh. And you can  see  it. You can see the little - little peaks, which is interesting. But yes. Yeah, exactly.
    
    
      
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      I wouldn't, uh - i- That's a case whe- you know, I know generally with the Tigerfish things that they put "breath" and we leave it in. But absolutely there, yeah. " Laugh ",
    
    
      Good. O_K.
    
    
      change it. And, you know, there are other places where it's in the way, you know.
    
    
      I - I  mainly  said not to change their "breath"'s simply because it would take time to  move   them   if - and if they're not in the way then don't - don't mess with it, but -
    
    
       A  lot  of times, though, the breaths are, um,
    
    
      results of bad segmentation,  and there's a segmentation of nothing,  and so they
    
    
      Oh yes!
    
    
      just write it as a breath when it's clearly not a breath.  And I usually always take those out. I mean,  usually, 
    
    
      Yeah. I've taken out some of those.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      um, it seems like the segmenter, um, often
    
    
      Great.
    
    
      just sort of, um, segments -
    
    
      when there's really long spaces,  it segments random spaces in between.  And th- you know, they get that and there's nothing there, so they m- s- mark it as a breath when it's really actually nothing. 
    
    
      That's right.
    
    
      So usually I take those out.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       
    
    
      Well they give the segmenter, though - cuz they don't  have  the - the rich
    
    
       interface  that we do,  so the- they must be giving the pre-segmenter sort of the benefit of the doubt, "Well, there  must  be  something  there,
    
    
      Right. Right. Exactly, exactly.
    
    
      um, whether I can hear it or not." So, they just say, "Well, it's a breath then".
    
    
      Oh, yeah. I'm sure they are.
    
    
      Exactly.
    
    
      One  wonders  what it might be - Yeah. 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Although, they  did  put a "missing segment"
    
    
      Yeah, there are some where -
    
    
      so- sometimes in brackets.
    
    
      Yes!
    
    
      Oh really? Oh, I always get - I always get " breath ".
    
    
      That's true.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Well, see, I - I do a previous filtering before I give the Tigerfish ones out, and - and I u-
    
    
      I've gotten  both. 
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      I have tried to get the - that particular the - the "missing segment" removed. But I don't always
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah. I've seen a few of them, but I've seen a - several "breath"'s too.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      do it. So yeah, you've s- they slip through.
    
    
      Well,  frequently  that'll also be a misattribution too, of voice.
    
    
      Hmm!
    
    
      Yeah! Yeah.
    
    
      Cuz then you'll hear  - you'll hear part of what another person is saying and th- tha- and that's all transcribed on that one
    
    
      level, but then you'll  hear   a little bit of it and then "missing segment". It's like, "O_K, well they just - it's in the wrong -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      It's just in the wrong place. 
    
    
      That person's not talking at all". So, you just get rid of it.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      So.
    
    
      Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      Interesting.
    
    
      O_K, well, let's see,
    
    
      so, um, do you think that this has changed your speech - n-
    
    
      in  other  ways, in terms of -
    
    
       Myself,  I do feel that I'm -  when I spend a lot of hours doing this I become less fluent. I
    
    
      Really?
    
    
      have more false starts and things. Yeah. I don't know if it's - It could just be because there're so many more hours I haven't been talking. 
    
    
      Hmm!
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      I guess I try to be more  careful  in my speech,
    
    
      more often.
    
    
      Good.
    
    
      Unless I'm really not paying any attention like, you know, if I'm at a party or something, and I'm just
    
    
      sort of having a good time, then it doesn't really matter, but
    
    
      in n- you know, normal one-on-one speech I -
    
    
      I think I tend to
    
    
      try to enunciate more. 
    
    
      Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Cuz I've been  told  I mumble.
    
    
      Oh! Huh!
    
    
      Um,
    
    
      and I guess I used to be worse about it. I was
    
    
      told by my parents that I used to mumble a lot.  
    
    
      
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      Uh,
    
    
      and also I - I have this sort of
    
    
      East Coast accent that comes in sometimes that makes it hard for people on the West Coast to understand what I'm saying. 
    
    
      Hmm!
    
    
      A lot of times like, uh, if I'm not paying attention I'll say something
    
    
      that,
    
    
      uh, will
    
    
      not really be heard. I tend to leave off final consonants, for instance,
    
    
      
    
    
      and people, uh, n-
    
    
      I have to be conscious of that sometimes. Yeah, so.
    
    
      Hmm!
    
    
      So mainly for clarity, it sounds like, like in phrasing or strategies.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Hmm. One thing that  I  noticed -
    
    
      I don't know if it's a - really a question of me being more c-
    
    
      changing my speech necessarily,  but I'm much more  aware  of interruptions in conversation - in normal conversation.
    
    
      Oh!
    
    
       Oh, yeah. That's true.
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      So, uh, maybe I am more careful  in the sense that I
    
    
      maybe don't interrupt as much, or j-
    
    
      I'm more  aware  of it when I  am  doing it,  or something like that,  but,
    
    
      um, I just
    
    
      pay attention more to the fact that every -
    
    
      pretty much all the time in normal conversation there are interruptions. There's no - I mean, unless you have really aw- I mean, I think if there  were  no interruptions it would sound really  awkward. 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      There would be a lot of  pauses,  and that would kind of i-
    
    
      imply  uncomfortability,  or something.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      But,
    
    
      I guess it depends partly on the type of interruption. I mean, if it's a  clarifying  type like - "well do you mean - ?" when they're partway through it in a utterance.
    
    
      yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      It's different.
    
    
      Yeah. I tend to think of a conversation that has no interruptions as
    
    
      being something  that's   -
    
    
      n- unnatural and forced. Or something like a meeting where, you know, I mean everybody says -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      their little schpiel and people are meant to be,
    
    
      you know, pretty - pretty quiet and attentive for the most part. And then they let them finish, and then somebody else comes in and says something about it.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Um,
    
    
      and in a n- like a  friendly  conversation I - I notice that that's  not   really   true.  Like what you were saying.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
       But even in cases like that, 
    
    
      even when it
    
    
      is -
    
    
      see now I'm contradicting myself, but even when it is very - turn-taking is very w- like people follow the turn-taking rules, or whatever, and don't really blatantly interrupt people, 
    
    
      um,
    
    
      and I - I  remember  this actually from a  meeting  because Liz was complaining there wasn't enough o-  interruptions, 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      or e- not enough  overlaps,  or  something.  It wasn't interruptions it was  overlaps,  that I was thinking about. Not enough overlaps. And so she wanted to - there to be an argument or something so that there'd d- be  more.  And ch- what she didn't  realize  was
    
    
      Huh!
    
    
      Uh-huh. I think this is really - yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      that  throughout  the  meeting  up  until  then there  had  been,
    
    
      they were just  very   small,  but they were  there. 
    
    
      I think they're  there  pretty much a- all the  time. 
    
    
      I agree. I did - I did do one analysis wh- where I looked at one meeting,
    
    
      That's interesting.
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      and, um - th- cuz the claim had been, actually o- one of the
    
    
      people in the meeting had made the claim in the  previous  meeting that, "Well, there -  probably  the overlaps  only  occur during setup
    
    
      and, um, you know, at the end when we're  leaving. " 
    
    
      Oh!
    
    
      Hmm!
    
    
      Oh yeah, that's  totally  not  true. 
    
    
      Yeah!
    
    
      No, not at all.
    
    
      Exactly. Exactly. Well, and, you know, I think that that's sort of the  feeling  you would  get  if - unless you looked at the data at this level. And so I did an analysis and in fact it was really a pretty constant rate
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah!
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      all the way through the entire meeting and  everyone  was involved.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Wasn't just one, you know, or two speakers. Everyone was - Yeah. It's quite true.
    
    
      Kind of makes  sense  because
    
    
      if you're - if you wanna speak  next,  it's almost like you got y- you gotta get your  foot  in the door. You gotta be the one who - you know, make sure people recognize that  you're  the one who's gonna speak next. 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      That's true.  I should say, I didn't distinguish between overlaps and - and  interruptions.  So some of these were backchannels and things like that. But it's still - It's  still  the case. You have -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Oh, I see. Uh-huh.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I think, um,  silences  are generally like  not good in conversation too. Cuz once you get a
    
    
      y- you -
    
    
      
    
    
      sil- You know, it - it - it's to your benefit to -
    
    
      to try to get in right when you think they're done because if there's a silence, not only is it awkward,  but then that sort of cues everybody to start thinking of a new topic to stop the silence,  
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      and then you don't get to talk about what you wanted to talk about  because the whole subject has changed.  
    
    
      And then everybody talks at once.
    
    
      That's true. That's very true.
    
    
      You know, thinking about it, 
    
    
      You know? S-
    
    
      I - I think I've only noticed a couple times where there's been actual  silence  on all channels for a period of time.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
       It's true. That's  very  rare. I agree.
    
    
      Hmm!
    
    
      It's only been like  twice.  Yeah.
    
    
      It's rare.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Interesting observation.
    
    
      Yeah. Well, if they're  i- c- if -  this has raised a couple of things for me that I wanted to mention because, you know, at  this  point, we're at the - at the really fine grain level of -
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      of standardization which I hadn't really  thought  of specifying in advance before, and, um,
    
    
      wanted to maybe just mention a couple of things. These are,
    
    
      um -
    
    
       Yeah , I don't think that these are very  common.  But with the idea that - what we're trying to do is encode the communicative stuff,
    
    
      um,
    
    
      when we have these grey areas, um,
    
    
      w- um,
    
    
      I wanted to draw attention to the fact that there are sometimes these stretches where a person is trying to say something and formulating their thought, and they're coming out with a  bunch  of
    
    
       segments,  which really aren't part of a  word. 
    
    
      Have you run across that where they're - they're saying   and then they say a word.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, yeah, yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      And,  my  feeling on that is, that
    
    
      this isn't really
    
    
      a phonological transcript,
    
    
      and  potentially  those things could probably be rendered, although some of them are not even full  segments,  they're even sub- s- subsegmental, I would say. I mean, you got a - a single flap of a vocal cord sometimes, and,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
       Yeah.
    
    
      you know, they're th- it's like the - the apparatus is sort of
    
    
      almost kicking in, they're almost gonna say  but it hasn't - somehow this - somehow this vibration hit before the rest of it and -
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      and that's not  communicative.  So, um, my - my the way  I  do those things when I hear those, if -
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      is to - I use in parentheses one "X_"  so it's marked.
    
    
       
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Or if it's   then I  - then I put six or seven or however many it is -
    
    
      
    
    
      Then - Right.
    
    
      
    
    
      That's what I usually do too. Yeah.
    
    
      I was  wondering  who had been putting those  in. 
    
    
      Great.
    
    
      And then - and then what I do is I put in, um, brackets, um,
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       uncodeable   - Sorry, "Uncodeable vocal sounds".
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Oh, O_K. O_K.
    
    
      And of course, potentially they're codable, but i- I just wanted to mark roughly how man- how long it is,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      then indicate
    
    
      what - what the nature of it is, so no one's gonna try and go back and - and decode it as something that's pechen- a- a word that was not - It has a different status than parenthesized,
    
    
      uh,
    
    
      parts when there  are  words involved,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      just to set it aside, have some sort of a length indication, and sometimes I'll even put them in a - in a separate bin, although that's -
    
    
      that's not necessary. It's just sometimes it works out that way that they ,  they do this thing. I shouldn't do that so often. I'm sorry about that.  They do this sound,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      and then there's a  pause,  and  then  they start speaking, so then it's really  obvious,  I can - I can split it apart and it won't be any problem. I wanted to mention that one, yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      I'm glad you ment- brought that up because I actually - I'm one of the culprits that puts in all the little itsy bitsy tiny sounds in the middle of everything, 
    
    
      Man!
    
    
      
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      I do that too! I used to  do  that!
    
    
      because I was -
    
    
      because - Yeah. Cuz I was thinking, like, you're just supposed to write down everything you hear as closely as possible. 
    
    
      Well -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      And so, I'm glad you said that because, um, that actually takes
    
    
      a good amount of time, and like pretty strict concentration  to d- to do that. Um,
    
    
      A lot of time.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.  I put in the "X_"s. I put in - if it's, um, unintelligible I put - I count how many syllables and then I put in "six X_" -
    
    
      Excellent.
    
    
      and so -
    
    
      I do that if it's unintelligible, but if I can tell something - if somebody goes "r-"
    
    
      I'll put an "R_".
    
    
      Oh, I see.
    
    
      Eh - Um, so if they go "r- e- m- m-",
    
    
      I see.
    
    
      I'll go "R_" "E_H" "mmm" m- "M_" "M_".
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      So like I - I've been doing  that  because like that's what I can  hear.  And I'm pretty damn sure that - sorry. Sorry!
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Sorry. Hhh! 
    
    
       That will have to be transcribed with little, uh, symbols. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Sorry! I'm sorry.  I feel really bad now. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah. Like a - a skull and crossbones. 
    
    
       Right. 
    
    
      Oh no! I'm sorry! O_K -   Oh no, I'm so sorry. 
    
    
      That's O_K. It's alright. No problem. 
    
    
       You've ruined the whole meeting!  We can't transcribe  any  of it now!  
    
    
      It's not - i- it's -
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      It's  not  like you said the F_word. It's not - it's not an - it's still a P_G - 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      No, no, no. This is not -
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, seriously. 
    
    
      
    
    
      I wouldn't give it a second thought. 
    
    
       Oh yeah - I - I was -
    
    
      Do you remember what you were gonna say? 
    
    
      
    
    
      She's pretty darn sure that, uh,
    
    
      Ah - and then - tha- Yeah, that's wha- I'm sorry. 
    
    
      
    
    
      You sh- Yeah - 
    
    
      
    
    
      she could make it out probably. 
    
    
       O_K.   Right. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, no one's ever sworn in any of the meetings! That actually -
    
    
      Well, y- you've heard - have you heard "shoot"? I've heard "shoot" a couple of times.
    
    
      
    
    
      I've heard the -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Not the  swearword  version.
    
    
      Hmm -
    
    
      No, no, no, no, no, no, the
    
    
      
    
    
      Just "shoot".
    
    
      "shoot" type, yeah.
    
    
      I've heard the swearword version. Remember that? Remember that? It was a while back. I - it was a long time ago.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      That's O_K.
    
    
      Oh, you have?  I've  never heard the swearword versions.
    
    
      Yeah?
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      I  do  remember that.  Yeah. 
    
    
      Yeah, and I was like, "Oah!"   I emailed you, I was like, "M- You might wanna check this out."  Yeah, I  do  remember that. But it was very quiet. So I can see how that would have been sort of
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      That's right. That's right. Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      gone over by accident. It was just very quiet, like kind of under the breath  kind of thing, so that's why it was missed. I can understand. Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Uh-huh, yeah. Yeah, it was.
    
    
      Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Hmm!
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      B- but y- t- finish your point. So, y- 
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh!  I was just  - I was just  saying that, um, I - I can  - I'm pretty sure that I can tell what - exactly what sounds are being produced. So if it's
    
    
      
    
    
      Yes. Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      "er", I write an "R_". If it's "mmm", I can tell it's -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Then again, I always think that it's closer to stick with the "X_"s because it's, like,
    
    
      Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
    
    
      how effective is, you know, the Roman alphabet at deciphering all the sounds that a human can make.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      You know, it's not the I_P_A and - it's just, I - I just sort of think, um,
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      it's best to leave it with "X_"s because I - 
    
    
      y- English orthography conventions are just so,
    
    
      you know, uncertain  anyway  in the  first  place, and, um -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      you know, I - I usually only use them when I - I know that, um,
    
    
      the person was trying to  make  a  word.  I mean, I know that the - the word they were trying to say and that they were stuttering  that,  then I feel fine just
    
    
      you know, writing out the letters. But otherwise, I sort of don't
    
    
      feel right trying to write them out because I feel like it's, um -
    
    
      you can't really -
    
    
      Just not useful?
    
    
      Yeah, you can't really spell those things with the R- with the Roman alphabet, you know? It's - it was only set up for -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah?
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      it was set up for a different purpose, you know. Not necessarily so phonological.
    
    
       
    
    
      I agree. And I think there's another problem too, and that is that we  do  have some short words which  are  communicative. And - and sometimes - So, if you have an
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      "E_R" as part of one of these  fragments,  we  do  have a
    
    
      lexicalized "er" which is a - which is a -
    
    
       Right.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      a filler item.  Does  have a meaning. So I think for both of the reasons it's good to just leave it in this category of not really communicating in a - in a word-like way.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      So even if it's "er", or -
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      I would keep "er". Well, "E_" - "er" - "er" if it's a filler. So, "I mean, er,"
    
    
      Oh, you would keep "er".
    
    
      Right, right.
    
    
      Mmm -
    
    
      th- that - that - that stays. But if it's p- uh, part on these little fragments, no.
    
    
      Right. Oh, O_K.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Oh yeah. I always -
    
    
      I often transcribe that as
    
    
      "or". I always thought that was "or" sort of with a strange pronunciation.
    
    
      Oh. 
    
    
      I'm making a distinction.
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      So you have the, um,  comic  "er"  where   the person says something and then they pretend that they didn't wanna  say  that, and then they throw in an "er".
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Oh. Oh, I don't get  that  one.
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      m- and that would be an "er". E_R. But if they're saying "or"
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      in a reduced way so it comes out as "er", do it as "or".
    
    
      R-
    
    
      
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      O_K. m- O_K.
    
    
      Cuz that's - that falls within the realm of pronunciation variants. It's just like different ways of saying "and".
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      O_K. And I have like, uh, uh, two more things I wanted to say. One of them is, um -
    
    
      Oh, yeah. This is an interesting category to me, and I don't,
    
    
      um, y- y- don't have to mark this systematically. But
    
    
      when you're going through the meeting, and what I'd like people to do if - if you're not - uh, uh - is to go through the meeting, um -
    
    
      So, if you're doing - you're doing separate channels first and then as a final pass through the  mixed  channel,
    
    
      I don't think I've made that explicit but it w- it's really helpful to go through it a - a final time though the mixed channel so that you hear things in context.
    
    
      And at  that  point what I sometimes pick up is this meta-level,
    
    
      where someone is - finishes someone's - someone else's utterance. So you'll suddenly have this stranded word out in the middle of nowhere, and it's because
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      this other speaker on this other channel was trying to formulate this thought, and they paused, and they paused just enough that this person leaped in and gave them a word.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      And I think those are interesting, so when I find that I - I note - note it as, you know, finishing -
    
    
      
    
    
      put capital letters. Capital letter, capital letter, colon,
    
    
      apostrophe "S_", utterance.
    
    
      Oh!
    
    
       Wait, wait.  How  do you mark it?
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Wait.
    
    
      We add the -
    
    
      So, if  - so in the examp- i- in the instance in which - Let's say that, um,
    
    
      Morgan's talking,
    
    
      uh, so,
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      he's talking.
    
    
      And then somewhere there's a bit of a pause, and let's say Adam
    
    
      fills in a word for him.
    
    
      Then what I do is, on Adam's channel,
    
    
      
    
    
      I say -
    
    
      I say, "Completing -"
    
    
      And this - this isn't that common of an occurrence.  "Completing speaker initial with a colon apostrophe "S_"'s utterance".
    
    
      Oh,  I  see.
    
    
      Oh!
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      And what that means is at the time when we - See we're gonna go to a stage of anonymization. So it's important to have the colon here because that'll make it possible to easily know,
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      you know, who it was without having to do the math involved in figuring out which channel it was. The problem with - I originally wanted to use  channel  numbers as the referent
    
    
      index, but that - that's not  functional  because we have these two different  numbering  schemes. You have the numbering in the
    
    
      Channeltrans interface and you have the numbering in the "key" file and those can be very different. So, you know, to be able to,
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Right. Right.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      uh - Th- this is redundant in a useful way in that you know that you're not gonna make a mistake.  I  tried to do it with the  numbers  and I was making all sorts of inconsistent problems, so I stopped it.
    
    
      So  that's  probably why you, like, added in
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      that, um, thing that automatically puts in the
    
    
      people's initials.
    
    
      Initials?
    
    
      That's - that's - I did that partly to keep track of things. Absolutely.
    
    
      Absolutely. Somet-
    
    
      I- I also found that it was easier to  deal  with the meetings when there are speaker initials. Yeah.
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      Oh yeah.
    
    
      Initials.
    
    
      The initials? I'm glad to hear that. I st- I didn't do that systematically until, uh, really rather recently, so. I-
    
    
      Yeah. I find it much easier.
    
    
      I'm glad to know that's useful. It s- takes an extra step. Glad it's useful. O_K, now I just have one more thing to say and that is that, um, um,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      like once - this is just such a rea- I'm getting down to like the really eensy-weensy stuff. But, um,
    
    
      once  I found a comment that, uh, in- in curly brackets about mumbling. And, um,
    
    
      i- g-
    
    
      that's - that's - this is just to mention an instance that happened once, it's really grasping for details. But, um,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      I - I -
    
    
      f- I think, and it may be that it was not from anybody here, so.  But I think that, um, "mumble" is only useful in the s- to  me,  in the sense of "whispered",
    
    
      if it's like a manner of speaking, in which case it's a "QUAL".
    
    
      But not in terms of replacing, like, this string of undecipherable fragments. So,
    
    
      Right. Oh yeah.
    
    
      Oh, right.
    
    
      um, this - this was u- when it was used - exactly. It was used in place of, uh, something that was in- unintelligible.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      They used "mumble" for -
    
    
       O_K.  
    
    
      To fill in. I see.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      
    
    
      In which case, it would be better to use parentheses and - and
    
    
      The number "X_".
    
    
      either exclamation,  or the number of syllables, if you know.
    
    
      And then do "QUAL mumbled" or "QUAL whispered" or something.
    
    
      Exactly. If it's a manner of speaking, then it's useful. And otherwise the parentheses with an estimate of syllables is better.
    
    
      I see.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
       O_K.  
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      O_K. So, I guess, you know, I don't wanna keep you.  I kept you so long. I really appreciate this. Yes?
    
    
      Can I ask one more thing about these comments. So we  are  for -
    
    
      "QUAL" is used for things like
    
    
      "whispered", or "said while laughing", or things of that nature. Um, I remember at some point we were doing a difference between vocal and non-vocal sounds?
    
    
      Yes. Mm-hmm.
    
    
       Oh.
    
    
      Yes. Oh, but - Good question. And you don't have to add  any  of those tags.
    
    
      Oh!
    
    
      The only tags that you need to add, is - So - th- uh, there's like  one  exception that's just microscopic, and that is, sometimes -
    
    
      this is again really rare, sometimes I've run across the word "noise".
    
    
      And offhand, I don't know if that's a vocal noise or non-vocal noise.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      And so then I listen to it and I figure it out.
    
    
      But that's the only place you would use a "vocal"-"non-vocal" tag, where it's potentially ambiguous between those two categories. Cuz otherwise, what  I  do when I get these, is -
    
    
      and of course I do my checks, and then I have a, um - a script that I wrote which will separate everything in - out that has curly brackets, do a listing of them,
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      and then anything -
    
    
      Some of them already have tags from some previous, uh, modification, but anything that  doesn't,  I just go through this list,
    
    
      and I - I k- tag it right then. And so, in one - in one -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      in one change, I can modify, you know, five hundred
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      instances of this. So there's no need to add the "vocal" or the "non-vocal".
    
    
      Very efficient.
    
    
      O_K. But for, like, noise that we
    
    
      Hmm!
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      know is
    
    
      something like mike noise, or something like a door, whatever, then we can mark it as that and no-
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      You can either - if you mark it "mike noise" then I'll know what kind of noise it is when I go through the thing and put V_O_C or N_V_C on the - in the substitution file.
    
    
      Yeah,  right. Or - o- or if it's -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      But it's - it's uh, very efficient for me to add those tags later.
    
    
      It's really not -  The  same thing with the "QUAL". Just so long as I can tell which of those three categories it is. Or -
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      or "pron",  but, you know, those - that's really very obvious, the pronunciation.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      So long as I can tell what they are. I think it's good for you to add the "pron".  I would appreciate the "pron",  come to think of it.
    
    
      So we  do  need to add that one?
    
    
      O_K. Sure. O_K.
    
    
      Good.
    
    
      But the other three - i- just so long as it's clear to me, w-
    
    
      you know, from the comment which of those three it is, then I'm fine.
    
    
      Good.
    
    
      That's great.
    
    
      Alright, so, um, I guess, um,
    
    
      Do you wanna read digits? Do you wanna do that?
    
    
      Oh, thank you, do we have time? Would you mind? Can we do digits? O_K, so why don't - do you wanna do it, uh, in  unison  this time?
    
    
      Yeah, that's fine.
    
    
      Yeah. That's fine.
    
    
      No?
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      That's what we did last time.
    
    
      Well, we did it in unison last time.
    
    
      We did it -
    
    
      Oh we  did!  Oh! Do it separately, then. O_K. Good deal.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Sure did.
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh, and do you want us to mark the t- roughly the time we start?
    
    
      
    
    
      That is really what that time field is. I used to think it was the beginning of the meeting, but yes. Quite right. Quite right. That'd be good.
    
    
      Oh, O_K.
    
    
      Oh, O_K.
    
    
      Oh, alright. 
    
    
      The time we start digits? O_K.

      Yeah.
    
    
      O_K. So, who wants to start?
    
    
      
    
    
      Well, I guess I'll start.  O_K. Transc- And the time is - O_K. Um,
