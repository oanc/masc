				Raids
			Baghdad 8-15 (AFP) -
			Iraq protested strongly to the United Nations against American and
				British air raids which targeted civilian installations in southern
				Iraq, killing two people and injuring 23 others according to a report by
				the official Iraqi news agency today, Tuesday. According to Baghdad, two
				civilians were killed and 23 others injured during two attacks by
				American and British planes on Friday and Saturday against civilian
				installations in the town of Samawa in southern Iraq. Al-Sahaf added:
				"These two regimes are directly involved in the attack against Iraq
				through their support of air raids by American and British planes and by
				allowing these planes to fly from air bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait."
				Aziz said: "The continuous falsehoods spread by Kuwait's rulers are
				aimed at manufacturing an artificial crisis to give the Americans and
				British a pretext to continue their attacks on Iraq and keep the
				sanctions against its people in place." Since late 1998, almost daily
				skirmishes have taken place between Iraq and American and British planes
				patrolling the no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq. Baghdad does
				not recognize these no-fly zones for which no international resolution
				has been passed. According to a count prepared by Agence France Press,
				based on official Iraqi statements, American and British raids inside
				Iraq have resulted in 302 deaths and 900 injuries since 1998.
