      in the meeting you could like 
    
    
      have this secret thing that would play music if you're -  if you got bored. Give you stock quotes . Nobody would know, right? 
    
    
       Yeah, that's right!

      you have to turn those things  on  if they're not on already. Are they -

       O_K,  Looks good.
    
    
      
    
    
      Hi, hi, hi.
    
    
      
    
    
      Channel - Oh, I'm on two. Good.
    
    
      
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Hello? Hello? I'm - I'm on  zero!  Yes!
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh, uh I'm being recorded by the wire.
    
    
      You  are  on zero.
    
    
      Hello?
    
    
      The - the wireless ones are actually labeled.
    
    
      Hello?
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I'm on channel four? Channel four, channel four, channel four?
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh, they're already labeled?
    
    
      They have a little piece of tape.
    
    
       
    
    
      Yeah, that's what I figured out. No? I'm, uh -
    
    
      Why? That was good.
    
    
      And is that the channel number or the microphone number?
    
    
      Well, I mean, you're counting maybe from one instead of zero, so.
    
    
      
    
    
       
    
    
      That's r- exactly the problem. 
    
    
      Hey.
    
    
      
    
    
      Subtract one from the mike number to get the channel number.
    
    
      Hey.
    
    
      Hey.
    
    
      You know,  I  have a feeling we're on reversed. Does yours say "three"?
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      And what about these?
    
    
       and Mike are coming on my channel.
    
    
      Or maybe add one.
    
    
      No, no, no, no, no, no.
    
    
      
    
    
      Where's the - 
    
    
      No, no. You subtract - He was just saying trap- subtract one.
    
    
      Is it labeled?
    
    
      No?
    
    
      But you have to - the channel - uh the number on the mike is the number on the screen plus one, of course. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh, thank you. Sss- this is the problem.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Good. O_K, good, good, good.
    
    
      
    
    
      Of course. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Thank you.
    
    
      Cuz, uh, otherwise we would've -
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       
    
    
      So I guess I am channel eight. 
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Whoa!  I guess so.

      You look ni- You  look  nine.
    
    
      Hello? 
    
    
      Yeah, I'm number three. That's right. O_K.
    
    
      So, yeah.
    
    
      Funny, you don't look a day over seven. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Well, thank you.
    
    
      This is kinda fun.
    
    
      So I guess now we have a lot of censors- self-censorship going on. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       No,
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, yeah.
    
    
      That's right.
    
    
       
    
    
      But it won't last long.
    
    
      No!
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, so it's r- it's remarkable how quickly people forget.
    
    
      This is -
    
    
      No, we got to relax and let go. 
    
    
       It probably -
    
    
      Ch-ch. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      These  are  disturbing. Being just in front of your ears, it -
    
    
      So far, e-
    
    
      you can - you can hear the  shadow  it creates.
    
    
      Oh! Really? 
    
    
      There was this like little acoustic shadow
    
    
       Oh, god.
    
    
      from having this in front, yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah? Uh-huh.
    
    
       You  can hear it. 
    
    
      Uh.
    
    
      
    
    
      Well, I can - I can  feel  it.
    
    
      The rest of us -
    
    
      You h- you must have  much  better ear. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      And so far every meeting I've recorded someone has at one point or another said, "Oh, I probably shouldn't have said that." 
    
    
      That's amazing.
    
    
       There's  too much -
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      So I think they're - they're -
    
    
      So,  Harry,  we should maybe record some of your  clicks  and, you know.
    
    
      
    
    
      I've been  clicking   plenty. 
    
    
      
    
    
      He - he's a -
    
    
      But they don't show up.
    
    
      the sound effect man.
    
    
       
    
    
      Wow! That's great! 
    
    
      Yeah. Alright. 
    
    
      They don't show  up  on  that  thing.
    
    
      
    
    
      Well, I - I bet they're recorded
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       
    
    
      They'll be - they'll be deaf- deafening the transcriber. 
    
    
      Oh, yeah.
    
    
      quite loudly.
    
    
      Yeah, I'm sure - I'm  sure  they're  recorded.  
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, so it -
    
    
      
    
    
      They want to do something serious with this research. 
    
    
      They tend to clip.
    
    
      
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      That's a nice user interface, Dan. Very - what does "solo" mean?
    
    
       That's - that's really something.
    
    
      Uh, it means I was trying to think of things they put on real mixers that I should have on mine.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Ah! 
    
    
      Oh. 
    
    
      
    
    
      But it- it's really good. The solo actually -
    
    
      So you can feed it to the -
    
    
      Solo means you just -
    
    
      Ahh.
    
    
      feed it through the headphones, for example.
    
    
      cuz it's actually - you know, it's - it's how to - it's what can I - what application can I have for a - for a, uh,
    
    
      can -
    
    
      
    
    
      a class method rather - or a class - you know, a class procedure. So the solo by sa- satellite. Then if you click on one of the other ones, it clears that one.
    
    
       
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Oh, but it doesn't actually do anything  else? 
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
       Doesn't do anything , no, no. But I mean, it's - 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      So you've implemented radio buttons.
    
    
      
    
    
      It looks pretty slick though. That's great.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Ca- can - can we fast forward through this conversation?
    
    
      So -
    
    
       Oh, yeah, that's right.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, the uh,
    
    
      Actually I think this thing is really cutting the blood flow. I'm gonna pass out.
    
    
      No.
    
    
      those -
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Wait, you- you're going to be - you're going to be saying, you know, funnier things, so leave it on. 
    
    
       This is a very sensual thing.
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, I think a lot o- a lot of us ended up wearing it around your  neck  and then facing up.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      I kn- and, uh, just because there doesn't seem to be a good way to mount it.
    
    
       
    
    
      Maybe this is a  little  better.
    
    
      
    
    
      That's really nice.
    
    
      Yeah, I mean -
    
    
      Boy!
    
    
      
    
    
       Clearly  - I mean, my  impression  is i- if I have to wear this thing,
    
    
      you know, more than five minutes, uh, uh, uh, I mean, I - I will be completely affected by it somehow.
    
    
       Huh. 
    
    
      So.
    
    
      This -  this  thing? Or - or just  that  one? Yeah.
    
    
      I wouldn't be - Yeah. Oh.  That  -  that  one. The one I tried. I'd -
    
    
      
    
    
      I mean, on - on the temple's the pressure?
    
    
      They really press my temples, otherwise my ear channels, otherwise my joints here. I mean, depending where I put it,  it press different things,
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh yeah. That would give you a headache.
    
    
      What happened?
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      but that's a  fine. I mean -
    
    
       
    
    
      I think we have to add that to the - to the form they sign. 
    
    
      
    
    
      So - so the -
    
    
      Yeah. So, I mean, this - this thing of course is
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yes, that's right. The medical.
    
    
      
    
    
      I think -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      probably, you know, acoustically more challenging but  I   like  this. 
    
    
      Oh, yeah. But  this  is very comfortable. I mean, I - I could wear this without any difficulty.
    
    
      Th-
    
    
      Is it?
    
    
      Can you convert these ear ones to something comfortable? I mean, just by
    
    
      They have so much pressure at th- it's -
    
    
      putting little -
    
    
      But - but there - there I think, is a t- you know,
    
    
      I -
    
    
      We c- we'd - we'd have to  buy  new ones.
    
    
      Yeah, this is just m- bad design. This, um, this is -
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Or j-
    
    
      Yeah, I mean, you can just use the microphone and take the headband off.
    
    
      
    
    
      The - the other wa-
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      the other way I  had  it, which  might  work, is you put  one  over an ear
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      and then you can adjust the  other  one.
    
    
      Uh-oh.
    
    
      And that didn't -  that  seemed to be pretty -
    
    
      Ouch. 
    
    
      That doesn't work for you?
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      No.
    
    
      A- Anything which is distracting or painful,  is going to impact negatively  with this .
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      So - so you see how  Jane's  wearing it?
    
    
      But maybe the -
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
       That  seems to work O_K too.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      It's very comfortable.
    
    
      But I mean, but at that point - at that point it wouldn't be much different to - to wear this or that. 
    
    
      And you just have to bring it up.
    
    
      Yeah, go to that.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Right, right.
    
    
      Well, except you can bring it quite a bit closer to your mouth.
    
    
      
    
    
      Hhh.  O_K.
    
    
      So.
    
    
       But, uh, yeah, but it's not such a - it's not such a directional microphone probably.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      I mean, but probably this is designed in such a way that it should be closer. And this, eh, eh - but this is designed to be worn like this - to be worn like this.
    
    
      Yeah. Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Right. So.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, we - maybe we should look into  if we can buy a replacement. If they're eighty bucks,
    
    
      Sure.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      that might be worth doing cuz they're very uncomfortable.
    
    
      I mean, I really like this. Uh I - I mean, if I have to design the thing, uh I - I would rather, you know, use this type of thing than the other ones.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       Well, I mean, what you'd  rather  do is nothing at  all, 
    
    
      And also i- is -
    
    
      
    
    
       Wow. 
    
    
      Just trying to give you a hard transcription task.  No. I'm sorry.
    
    
      of course,
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      but to get - to get a good quality - I mean, if - if you were listening to it  downstairs,  that one's  quite  a bit lower  quality. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Hey, whi- what - where are ?  
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      What are you doing? 
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, yeah, I  noticed  that. I  noticed  that.
    
    
      Do you s- do you know - Have you studied a click language?
    
    
      So.
    
    
      But, you know, that - that might be the  challenging  part. I mean, because otherwise you are -
    
    
      I don't  -
    
    
      No, I wish. No.
    
    
      Wow.
    
    
      No. Just studied phonetics in general.
    
    
       Yeah.  
    
    
      If it didn't - if it didn't  hurt,  you know, if it was  comfortable  but you knew it was there, would it bother you?
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      I'll just take - 
    
    
      
    
    
      If it was comfortable -
    
    
      Yeah. Well - well try this one on.  
    
    
      Because I actually think it sort of makes everybody act a little more professional.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Because I find this one doesn't bother me at all.
    
    
      I didn't know that you could whistle that - You're a very soft whistler, you're  mostly  able to do that without much air at all, aren't you?
    
    
      
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      I think you forget pretty quick.
    
    
      Actually, I use something like this on - on the telephone and it's very comfortable.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I, uh,
    
    
      I, uh,
    
    
        Yeah, it's weird. It's kind of, uh,
    
    
      Your  telephone,  and people use it for cell phones and.
    
    
      I mean, no.
    
    
      I mean, no.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Still, I - I - I mean, I'm kind of more deaf on this ear, whatever this is on. Uh, I could wear it this way.
    
    
      Still, I - I - I mean, I'm kind of more deaf on this ear, whatever this is on. Uh, I could wear it this way.
    
    
      apical-alveolar kind of thing. I don't know. It's -  You know?
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      O_K. O_K.
    
    
      Right, cuz you've got -
    
    
       
    
    
      Wow, that's amazing! 
    
    
      I don't know, I feel distracted.
    
    
      I don't know, I feel distracted.
    
    
      Get a very high pitch that way too. And you get dogs to d- cock their heads and stuff. It's really good.  Cuz you can get really high. 
    
    
      Yeah it is, yeah.
    
    
      I mean, it's my impression. I mean, of course there is a lot more work to do with this one but -
    
    
      I mean, it's my impression. I mean, of course there is a lot more work to do with this one but -
    
    
      Oh, how fun!
    
    
      Can you project it pretty well? I mean -
    
    
      No. Not too well. Yeah.
    
    
      O_K. O_K.
    
    
       
    
    
      But they're just very, very sensitive.
    
    
      Um, I  guess  the  other  reason is I used -
    
    
      I mean if - if you want something really - really  nonintrusive,   really nonintrusive, really something that -
    
    
      But it's that you get enough of the high frequencies. Yeah, that you really get - you really get animals like -     
    
    
      Fascinating! Wow. 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Well, I guess my feeling is that this is for collecting a  corpus  not for an actual end-user application. 
    
    
      Huh.
    
    
      
    
    
      And so I think a  little  bit of intrusion is not  ridiculous.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Not for this, for  sure.  No. I mean, it's just - But talking in general, yeah, that's, uh -
    
    
      
    
    
      So -
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      I think you can't do any research otherwise.
    
    
      
    
    
      Well -
    
    
      
    
    
       What exactly is the purpose of the corpus? What's the purpose of the -
    
    
      Yeah, I agree.
    
    
      It's just -
    
    
      I mean, you think - you think if you -
    
    
      It's  too   hard. 
    
    
      Training s- Training speech recognition systems.
    
    
      It's too hard without -
    
    
      Do you think this is going to be too f- too -
    
    
      Right. But it will train them to the microphone characteristics of this c-
    
    
      I think you should collect  both   simultaneously. 
    
    
      
    
    
      We wanna do  both.  So - so the - the point is that
    
    
      
    
    
      And -
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      if you - if we try,
    
    
      It's gonna be too hard to do it without a -
    
    
      from the get go, to do it off the P_Z_M, we won't get anything.
    
    
      Yeah, forget it.
    
    
      Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. I agree. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
    
    
      You won't be able to align. You won't be able to segment. You won't be able to do anything.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       So - no, I mean, the -
    
    
      You won't be able to get grants.
    
    
      You won't be able to get funding.
    
    
      So -
    
    
      
    
    
      Right! 
    
    
      No, I'm  serious. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       Hang on, hang on! 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I mean, you won't be able to show any results.
    
    
      
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      So.
    
    
      Oh, right, right, right. 
    
    
      I mean th-
    
    
      And with this - with this you're saying, you are also in that situation? 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Well, I mean, we haven't done the - the  detail  experiment but just from  listening  to it, it's pretty  bad, 
    
    
      
    
    
      It was pretty bad.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah. Yeah.
    
    
      It takes off quite a lot.
    
    
      whereas  these  are m- are
    
    
      
    
    
      very  good.  I mean, that's why -
    
    
      
    
    
      Well, yeah, I mean, that's really like having one of  these  almost, so.
    
    
      
    
    
      That's why if you - if you use DragonDictate or - or ViaVoice, or any of those others to do dictation you  need  to use these. There's just no other way around it.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Yeah, yeah, yeah.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       Somebody will design a comfortable
    
    
      close talking mike. I mean it's -
    
    
      there are too many applications to - for them not - to  not  do that.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Well, and as I said, I find  this  one -
    
    
      I mean, it may not  look  like  this  but.
    
    
      I find this one is no problem at all. The only thing is 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah it's  y- 
    
    
      a little bit of audio - a - a little bit of audio
    
    
      Yeah, this one's fine.
    
    
      degradation in one ear,
    
    
      Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      and I get a little bit of peripheral  vision,  but other than  that, 
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      it's not bad at all.
    
    
      
    
    
      We could -
    
    
       Those,  on the other hand, are very uncomfortable.
    
    
      I-
    
    
      Yeah, those are pretty bad. 
    
    
      Yeah, those are really
    
    
      So.
    
    
      
    
    
      Can - can't we buy an expander that you just - 
    
    
      bad.
    
    
      Uh -
    
    
      I'm  actually  finding this quite  comfortable  now that I've got it - I've got it just  right.  It's just -
    
    
      That's right. 
    
    
      
    
    
       I'm  surviving. Yeah, I uh 
    
    
      It depends, yeah I've -
    
    
      
    
    
       I think you have , you know,  he would . 
    
    
      
    
    
      I think he's about to pass out. That's why - 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      U- i-
    
    
      
    
    
      You guys gave  up  too soon. I think you just get  used  to it after five minutes. 
    
    
      It must have numbed the areas.
    
    
      So I - I guess -
    
    
      you know, maybe the problem is we got the  kid's  version.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      
    
    
      No, we got a  Japanese  version, you know that's - that's it, yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      And so - and what about this one? I mean, this thing wearing sideway- that - that can?
    
    
      Sorry.
    
    
      
    
    
      Uh the -
    
    
      
    
    
      It's wired.
    
    
       It's funny, I li- I kind of like this. So it actually gets most of its strength from - 
    
    
      from you know, the fact this thing's stuck in your ear.
    
    
      Oh, this would drive me crazy. I absolutely - people are very picky about this.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      And, yeah, uh I - and originally -
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      
    
    
      D- uh does it have a speaker? Does it have a speaker or - ? 
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Oh yeah, it  does. 
    
    
      Uh - Uh-huh.
    
    
      When I bought  those  things I originally got  this  version, cuz Plantronics makes uh you know, an in-the-ear one.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      And I really liked it but, other people didn't. So it just depends. I guess, you know, I've
    
    
      been using in-the-ear Walkman headphones, for you know, a long time, so I'm kind of used to that weird sensation having something stuck in my ear.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      But if, uh, 
    
    
      But that's painful. I can't -
    
    
      Whereas I used speech recognition for about four  years  using one of  these,  so I'm used to  this. 
    
    
      If you're not used -
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      You do.
    
    
      I don't use it anymore. Uh, my hands got better so I stopped using it. But, uh.
    
    
      Y-
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      So, for about four years I used DragonDictate and NaturallySpeaking
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Really? So you could actually produce like code or - ? 
    
    
      to do all my work.
    
    
      Oh, you're a -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah?
    
    
      It was really a pain.
    
    
       Code!  Right.
    
    
      Yeah, but I didn't have a choice. I mean, I couldn't type. So,
    
    
      Wow.
    
    
      That's an interesting language model I'm sure.
    
    
      Uh.
    
    
      So -
    
    
      Huh.
    
    
      uh.
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      The market is a captive market. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm, yeah.
    
    
      In fact, when I first came back to grad school that was a project I wanted to work on, "voice environments for programmers", but we couldn't get any funding for it and my hands got better. So
    
    
      
    
    
      that's how I ended up working on this project instead.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Huh.
    
    
      Good.
    
    
       Anyway.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      So, yeah. I don't know.
    
    
       So - so what are  you  guys doing? What's  your  project?
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Well, basically,
    
    
      the - the - the original project looks a  lot  like, you know, the - the p-  your  project. I mean, basically we set up with this, uh,
    
    
      
    
    
      idea of
    
    
      the - the - the meeting - the - the  mediated   spaces idea in general and then incr- incarnated in this room that will be mediated somehow by, you know, a computer to access information, to help along the meeting, and will be like two kind of
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      eh, f- main functions. One
    
    
      
    
    
      is the interaction with the computer which, as you said, you know, is your interaction with the P_D_A in your case,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
       
    
    
      where you kind of query it to ask for information, et cetera. At the same time,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      our process is somehow,
    
    
      you know, getting all this multi-channel information,
    
    
       
    
    
      doing some sort of, you know,
    
    
      cross, eh, channel, you know, cancellation and
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      transcribing the individual streams,
    
    
      not necessarily in real time.
    
    
      And the idea is y- you can eventually after the meeting
    
    
      query, you know, previous meetings and -
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      and there is all this work on transcription,
    
    
       
    
    
       similar  probably to what we do in  Switchboard  but with
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      better bandwidth,
    
    
      you know, but worse, 
    
    
      you know, environmental conditions.
    
    
      Worse acoustics.  Yeah.
    
    
      An- and then,
    
    
      you know, there is, all - all these issues about
    
    
      processing all this information, you know,
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      transcription, but then using, you know, prosody information to better, you know, segment, endpoint.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Eh, also using topic segmentation to help better classification of information or extraction of information.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      I mean,
    
    
      we didn't dare to say it will be just in a P_D_A you throw in the middle of a meeting. 
    
    
      
    
    
      I'm beginning to feel my heart beat now.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah. So. Yeah. This is - this is -
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      That -  that  was daring.
    
    
      The P_D_A one is very, very ambitious. And it's also - it's depending on
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      not only
    
    
      that - Uh, not only does it depend on I_RAM
    
    
      Hmm.  Mmm. 
    
    
      taping out and  working  as  specified,  it also depends on writing vectorized  speech  recognition algorithms which is non-trivial.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      So.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      But, you know, uh let's assume somehow the compu-
    
    
      processor power is going to be there.
    
    
      Whatever. I mean, initially you may do a  super-computer  for the transcription,  real time and then -
    
    
       Right, I mean, so - so one of our -
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      our back off  policy  on that if - if there's problems with  I_RAM  is it'll be a wireless link,
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      right? You'll dump the - the - dump the audio wirelessly to a network somewhere
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah. I - I mean, ou- uh we - we kind of set up this concept like
    
    
      and you'll do the recognition.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      a year and a half ago. And at that time I said,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      you know,  we  said,
    
    
      "don't worry about the - the compute power". I mean, it will be somewhere,  you know.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Well, we - we - we've had a lot of discussions about it and I think
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      maybe - I think t- to some extent it comes down to a religious issue. My religion is personal computers are good and terminal mainframes are bad.
    
    
      And so if you can get away with it, I don't want to have a terminal in my hand and a mainframe somewhere else.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, yeah.
    
    
      Um, the - too many things to cont-
    
    
       can   go wrong and you lack control.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I think the P_C revolution has  shown  how good it is if you can have the power  yourself. 
    
    
      Yeah, yeah.
    
    
      And so the I_RAM project provided us a  method  of
    
    
      having a very powerful thing in your hand.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      And so we wanna see what we can do with it but
    
    
      we'd also don't want the project to actually
    
    
      completely depend on it.
    
    
      So,
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      the project will go forward regardless of whether I_RAM works or not.
    
    
      I mean, our approach, somehow, I mean,
    
    
      
    
    
      I believe it's probably, you know, complimentary in many ways,
    
    
      is to focus on the actual deep technology
    
    
      that we have somehow in  speech.  And basically,
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      make progress on, you know, the algorithms. And then, you know, it will run somewhere. I mean,
    
    
       
    
    
      as you said, to - I mean, we would like the idea to have it there but -
    
    
      So w-
    
    
      but our focus is
    
    
      basically to develop the algorithms, to
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      push the state of the art
    
    
      on this transcription task.
    
    
      And, uh, the other task
    
    
      
    
    
      probably is also, you know, challenging the comp-
    
    
      So a-
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      the - the querying, uh, the command, control, or, you know, I mean, doing that in natural language.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
       Right, so the - so for us
    
    
      the Meeting Recorder  project 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      has a very similar
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      uh, approach.
    
    
      Me  personally,  for my P_H_ D  thesis, I'm sorta doing the other  way  and seeing
    
    
      how much speech recognition can I do on this little
    
    
      unit.
    
    
       Oh.  I see. You really are challenged to do that,
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      to put as much power as you can in the P_D_A.
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      O_K, uh, our approach is, you know, we do whatever is necessary
    
    
      to do it
    
    
      and, you know,  some  of it may go into  something, 
    
    
      depending on, you know, your scalable power.
    
    
      That's right. So - so the -
    
    
      As I said, the Meeting Recorder  project,  so we have people at U_W, people here working on robust algorithms that will be running on work stations. They won't be running on I_RAM.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      And then what  I'm  trying to do is see how much of it I can put on I_RAM.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Well, you know, is, eventually y- you will get all this
    
    
      Yeah, it's not -
    
    
      you know, sc- eh,
    
    
      higher and higher, you know,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      powers in these portable things.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      So as long as you have
    
    
      
    
    
      enough
    
    
      algorithms and technology to do something better if you have more processing power.
    
    
      I mean,
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      the - the situation now in the speech community is that,
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      you know, there is some boundary, some limit in the
    
    
      performance. And no matter how much processing you throw  in,  you don't get
    
    
      That's right, we don't even know what to  do  with it. We don't need to n-
    
    
      any better. And so we are trying to push that.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       Yeah.
    
    
      And then you have room to port whatever you  can  to, you know, smaller devices.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      You get the wrong answer  quicker  basically,  don't  you? Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, we don't even know what to do with their cycles.
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Right. 
    
    
      Sorry I interrupt you.
    
    
      
    
    
      We w-
    
    
      
    
    
      I was gonna say that,
    
    
      um, you know, in terms - So, Adam has a - you know, a particular agenda,
    
    
      um, but obviously there are lots of other things. And you know, it's the way that a project like this works so that
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      a group like this where we have students coming in, you know - It's - it's meant to be sort of a long term thing that
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      will get us data and people will be able to come along and look at different aspects of it. So it's not clear, you know, whether s- someone at U_W's gonna look at, um, beam-forming or whatever.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      But, you know,
    
    
      it's goo- it's a good property for us that there are a lot of different things you could do with it, and so it's - We - we  haven't  thought it through.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Yeah. Always .
    
    
      Yeah, yeah.
    
    
      But that's O_K, you know, it's kind of - it's fair enough.
    
    
      Like -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      As an example, we had a visitor who was working on speaker I_D, acoustic change detection.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Huh.
    
    
      Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
    
    
      And he has a very good  system  for that and - and he wants to use this corpus.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Exactly. I mean, it's one of the areas where Kemal is going to work, like, you know, speaker tracking, and speaker I_D. I mean,
    
    
      So.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      you want to know. I mean, if you have the people wired individually it probably is easier.
    
    
      Oh, it - th- what's nice about -
    
    
      But - but you know, in - in the  other  situation, you know.
    
    
      
    
    
      What's nice about getting this corpus is, i- with the people wired you have a excellent baseline.
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Right? You have a very easy problem and you can get  the  right answer,
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      You can get the ground truth. Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       to  ground truth very easily and then you can degrade it by using the P_Z_Ms, you can degrade it further by using  those  things.
    
    
      Yeah, yeah.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Yeah, yeah, yeah.
    
    
      And - and really see what you can do with a real system. So.
    
    
      Yeah, for example, when you go to your P_D_A system it's, uh, really an awful - open problem to determine how many speakers there are and where they change turns, uh.
    
    
      That's right.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      That's right.
    
    
      That's actually being ad- That's one of the problems that's being addressed at this year's evaluation, uh,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Oh, really? They're doing
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      which is taking place right now, actually.
    
    
      an unknown number?
    
    
      Right. You - you  do  need to figure out the number of speakers in the waveform.
    
    
       That's  good.
    
    
      Which, uh - Wha- Evaluation of -
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      This is a NIST evaluation. Um.
    
    
      Of the speaker I_D or something?
    
    
      This i-
    
    
      Eh, right, speaker verification.
    
    
      And what's the - what - wha- So what has the data been?
    
    
      What - what - what data are they using? What is the -
    
    
      Uh, Switchboard.
    
    
      Oh, O_K.
    
    
      Switchboard and, uh -
    
    
      I - I -
    
    
      We - Well, I mean - 
    
    
      We will also run so- some part of that, uh, evaluation  too  but probably not that segmentation part.
    
    
      
    
    
      But I don't know if they are using a
    
    
      different data for that. But I mean, it's - s-
    
    
      While I say "Switchboard", s- eh, of course there's  only two speakers.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      But, um, I don't know how they, uh, actually went about. Um.
    
    
      Cuz they were saying some - some - some - up to eight speakers. Maybe they -
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      maybe some other data for that part, you're right.
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      I mean, just mixing it wouldn't work because the channel characteristics are too different.
    
    
      No, no.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      So, uh, what we - what  we  were working on here was parts of Broadcast News.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      And so that - that's a slightly  strange  task because they tend to be long segments. But they were -
    
    
      they were parts that were interviews
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      that he worked on. And, uh.
    
    
      No. We've also, uh, s- done some of that as, uh, eh,
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      um, I mean, I have a so - small, uh, hacked up system which sort of, for - for the Broadcast News determines the approximate number of speakers and actually assigns some names to them.
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      This is something we did for the MAESTRO project, uh, for - for Rick.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      But, um, uh,
    
    
      yeah, uh, for - for Broadcast News it works much better actually. It's, uh,
    
    
      Yeah, he had - he got very good results.
    
    
      you do get eh, like in an interview, uh, nice long segments and -
    
    
      
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah, so I - I tried his
    
    
      
    
    
      on - his system on the Meeting Recorder stuff,
    
    
      
    
    
      um, but of course we don't have any trained
    
    
      neural nets or, uh -
    
    
      So - so his system was based on our hybrid neural net system
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      that we use for speech recognition.
    
    
      And so, uh, I was using the Broadcast News nets on
    
    
      this data.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      So of course it didn't do -
    
    
      didn't do t-  tremendously  well.
    
    
      And then the  other  problem also was that it doesn't handle overlap very well, his algorithm.
    
    
      Yeah, I mean Broadcast News is for this third-party listener, right?
    
    
      Hmm?
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      So they, you know if you were listening to an interview that sounded like  this,  you know, you'd turn off your  radio. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      That's right, with all the i- interrupts.
    
    
      So it's just got a d- it's a lot easier.
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      I think there are some programs in T_V. I've been trying to get this from -
    
    
      something like this from, you know, public
    
    
      cast uh w- eh eh.
    
    
      There are - there are some with a lot of overlap. Yeah.
    
    
      Um uh yeah, and they - but they - they do it somehow.
    
    
      They clean it up. I notice that they - they s-
    
    
      they sa- have some help with control of
    
    
      Mixing, yeah.
    
    
      what person to pick up.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      I - I mean there is some program at midnight somewhere. It's a bunch of, like, four people discussing and they, it's a lot clean.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Well -
    
    
      Like McLaughlin.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah. I yeah, probably.
    
    
      But the - but the worst - the worst case is Politically Incorrect where they don't really make any adjustments at all. And - and it's hard to even follow what they're saying. It's just - it's truly  totally overlapped.
    
    
      But yeah, they - they have -
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Uh-huh. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah. Uh, yeah. I've heard that - that - that sometimes. But it's - it's  O_K , though.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I think in - in -
    
    
      It's still in the forma- it's still in the format which is slightly more formal I think than, you know,
    
    
      So you don't think they - they fill it at all with any, you know -
    
    
      completely informal conversational speech.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Oh, I'm sure they do. They - I'm sure they have an audio engineer in the back.
    
    
      They -  I  am pretty sure they do. I mean, it's -
    
    
      They  will  do, a  bit.  Yeah.
    
    
      O_K, you guys are more in business that I am.
    
    
      it's -
    
    
      But it  - bu-
    
    
      
    
    
      it's  still,  you know, understandable.
    
    
      
    
    
      The host probably gets, uh, you know - gets a little bit more.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      My feeling is that when I - when I - when I've  seen  that show it's like there - there are sometimes people who totally take over the floor and other people are trying to get in, and they can never - never get access.
    
    
      Gets a little boost. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, yeah.
    
    
      Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
    
    
      It depends very much on the mix.
    
    
      Well, but that- that's different than an audio engineer fiddling with the mixing parameters.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, it's just, I - I know that there are periods where two people are talking in - t- at the same time and you're only able to hear
    
    
      Right?
    
    
      At the same time. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
    
    
      um, parts of the weaker voice.
    
    
      And, you know, that's - It's a style. It's a style. Uh, but I - but I've seen debates where - And you know it's apparently engaging people. Uh, it's been going on for a while now.
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      Yeah, yeah, yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, in many cultures it's not bad manners to -
    
    
      
    
    
      to speak on top of another one. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Sure. Absolutely. Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, I was thinking, if Transcriber were invented in Italy or something, 
    
    
      I- it somehow -
    
    
      
    
    
      it would have been handling multiple - in New York. 
    
    
       Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Or in New York - or in New York, high  involve   - high in- high involvement style.
    
    
      Yeah. I mean, could be reassuring, you know? Keep going, keep going.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      High involvement. That's - that's a
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      good way of saying it. 
    
    
      
    
    
      That's what it's called. Yeah.
    
    
      So what do we do?
    
    
      
    
    
      Well, I mean,
    
    
      It seems like there's a lot of overlap between our projects, so it would be nice to work together.
    
    
      I - I belie- I believe there is a lot of overlap and would be great to com- to - to
    
    
      There i- yeah, indeed. 
    
    
      
    
    
      basically take advantage of that to - to make a synergy more than an overlap, and, you know, help each other.
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      I - I believe each group has, you know, depths
    
    
      We -
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      in - in different, uh, areas, so.
    
    
      I mean, we clearly
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      c- should collaborate
    
    
      
    
    
      So is your intention
    
    
      for the best of everybody.
    
    
      to start collecting some meeting data?
    
    
      
    
    
      Uh,
    
    
      I, you know -
    
    
      There are no final - I mean, the official decisions I guess
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      have to be made
    
    
      in terms of resources to that. My personal opinion, if you ask, is that we  should  because
    
    
      the only way - I mean, if I learn  anything  on speech in - for the last, you know  -
    
    
      More data is better.  
    
    
      
    
    
      No, no, no. Um, you  need  a  task 
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      
    
    
      to really, you know, improve your system
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      for that particular environment. So right now we are focusing our research
    
    
      on doing evaluation type of, you know,
    
    
      
    
    
      in- incremental
    
    
      
    
    
      you know, improvements.
    
    
      So,
    
    
       Switchboard,  for instance. They have five is kind of - O_K, you have two people talking, it's the closest thing. But
    
    
      we really should move into the - you know, data that reflects as much as possible, the real
    
    
      scenario.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      And that- that's a way to improve. And then you do improvement on  that  particular database.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      So even if we don't collect the data to  train  models,
    
    
      we should collect data at least to evaluate progress.
    
    
      
    
    
      So what would be  nice  is if we could,
    
    
       
    
    
      uh, converge on - on formats and conventions, and so on,  and software. I mean, just -
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      And - and software too. I mean, things like rewriting this Transcriber tool and thi- that -  That  shouldn't be re- redone.
    
    
      I think that's the op-
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      And the transcription conventions -
    
    
      I, uh - uh - It shouldn't be  done.  
    
    
      You'd mentioned there was some possibility that somewhere else is going to - you might contract out to do the transcription?
    
    
      Yes. We're talking about that right now. I'm not sure how much I should say about it. So that the, uh -
    
    
      Can y-
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, that's what I was wondering. O_K.
    
    
      there's  some  possibility that we're gonna get a third c- party company to  do  the transcription  for  us
    
    
      Uh-huh?
    
    
      in exchange for the corpus.
    
    
      Is that in exchange for access to the c-
    
    
      Right,
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      and -
    
    
      So, on- one question. I mean, uh, this - this thing is also for you,
    
    
      
    
    
      made on internal funding? Or I mean, I know you're applying for some DARPA funding.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      We have a little bit of DARPA.
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh, you  already  got some.
    
    
      Uh, under the communicator project.
    
    
      O_K. O_K.
    
    
      So - so that's  part  of it. And then, uh, part of it's on the  I_RAM  group.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      I_RAM group is paying for part of it. And then part of it's just ICSI general funds,
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      is paying for it as well.
    
    
      And you're saying some of the infrastructure is, um, the A_T_and_T video conferencing.
    
    
      
    
    
      The infrastructure, yeah, they - th- they were paid - but they don't expect anything in return. They're just being very nice and
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      So pi-
    
    
      A free gift. Yeah.
    
    
      good neighbors and -
    
    
      and so they - they basically wanted stuff  anyway.  And then they just sort of allowed us to direct the audio portion of it to what we needed.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      So.
    
    
      And then, uh, U_W - I don't know if you mentioned this
    
    
      at the beginning but,
    
    
      the - Mari's group,
    
    
      Mari and Morgan - I th- I think what happened historically, um - Oh, I don't know how much I'm supposed to say if this is being recorded.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Well,  anyway,  uh. 
    
    
      Should we stop recording?
    
    
      You  are  on the line.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Mmm, huh. Um.
    
    
      This would  never  go away!
    
    
      There's funding, eh. 
    
    
      I - I can  pause  if you wanna  say  something that - that's sensitive. I mean -
    
    
      
    
    
      It's - No, it's O_K.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Um, I'll tell you later. 
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Sorry, listeners.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      And to our listening audience. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      That's  to the listeners. 
    
    
      Too bad you weren't here.
    
    
      You know, maybe  thousands  of people are listening to us now because it's in the future, but, you know, sequentially maybe thousands.
    
    
       
    
    
       Well, it does sort of make you -
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      That's right. It could be.
    
    
      
    
    
      It's -
    
    
      it's like you're behind closed doors but you have to -
    
    
      This could be the most popular corpus. Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      That's right. It's so funny, like we close the door and it's - 
    
    
      Normally a note taker would know not to do  that . O_K.
    
    
      
    
    
      Ha!
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      What I can do is say, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.  
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      But that's only on one sp-
    
    
      
    
    
      Anyway, U_W is getting some funding from DARPA on Communicator,
    
    
       Yeah.  
    
    
      I know, but we can blend it for the public. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Uh.
    
    
      uh, with - and that's sorta how I got involved. I mean, Morgan wanted me to sort of
    
    
      
    
    
      do  something.  I guess, I - My interest was sort of in the language and dialogue m- modeling, and the turn overlaps, and
    
    
      
    
    
      how to apply
    
    
      you know, a language model, a dialogue act model to actually feed down to do better recognition. So not just - Because I think it will be really difficult
    
    
      to do just speech recognition and then try to get some kind of meaning out of it. I think you have to have some kind of structure
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Feedback. 
    
    
      from the - I mean - Yeah.
    
    
      And -
    
    
      So knowing that an utterance is really short and low volume, you should be able to figure out it's a backchannel and things like that.
    
    
      Anyway,  apparently,  and you guys know more than  I  do,
    
    
      there was some talk that you were gonna build a portable version of this
    
    
       
    
    
      so that Mari's group -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      I - I mean, there's not a huge amount of funding in the way,
    
    
      
    
    
      you know, Mari
    
    
      probably won't be able to do a ton of
    
    
      collection. But
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      I was thinking if there were sort of prototype
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      collection devices or standards, then we could
    
    
      share data. And we would have like a
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
        monopoly  on that. Mar- I mean, once you get three sites
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      collecting data and each site can demo it, and say it's at the other two sites.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Which was - would be really good for funding purposes.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      But that - I don't really know. That's what I heard from Morgan, so.
    
    
      Yeah, I know. That - that's -
    
    
      We - we talked about that and -
    
    
      Is that -
    
    
      That's - that - that - that portable thing's been mentioned.
    
    
      It was -
    
    
       And according to Morgan it's like
    
    
      happening and -
    
    
      Well i- w- when I spoke with him he - he really just said it was a money issue.
    
    
      But that was -
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      That it's certainly not any sort of intellectual property issue  where we're perfectly willing to give people
    
    
      Oh, well. 
    
    
      those boxes. The boxes are cheap.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Um, but, you know, can they afford to get
    
    
      a six channel Sony wireless and can they afford the P_Z_Ms, and that sort of stuff.
    
    
      And he said something about a portable - You know, that they wouldn't have a dedicated room or something like - like you guys have here.
    
    
      Well -
    
    
      I think - I think
    
    
      somebody's got a unit which is something like the A_DAT or something, which,
    
    
      you know, it's a device which will record onto tape, uh, multiple channels.
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      And so I think that was - that was gonna be and we were g-
    
    
      Like someone actually has this knocking around.
    
    
      
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Some company that we were gonna - uh, was gonna lend it to us, something like this.
    
    
      This is -
    
    
      this is the same - same company that may be doing the transcripts for us, may be giving us -
    
    
      
    
    
      The same - it might be the same company or it might be a different company. There's  another  company which  also  has a - apparently has purchased a very -
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      may be giving us, uh-huh.
    
    
      
    
    
      a big multi-channel thing.
    
    
      Um, and so if we - if they could  lend  us that, we could imagine  doing  these kinds of recordings. I mean that you know, that like you said, the fundamental thing is
    
    
      
    
    
      it doesn't  have  to be this  hardware.  It's just the  idea  that you have multiple channels to synchronize data and then the post-processing can be uniform and stuff like that, so.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Right, and it doesn't have - You know, different sides can do different pieces of it I think.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      And it would also - it would be really  nice  to be able to do it in other rooms, cuz otherwise we're gonna learn a lot about this air conditioning. 
    
    
      And -
    
    
      Exactly. Right.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       That was, w- 
    
    
      And you'll get different kinds of conversations and different interactions, and
    
    
      
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      I think just having three different sites
    
    
      
    
    
      That'd be great.
    
    
      would be great
    
    
      Yeah, I agree.
    
    
      just for sort of diversity, and so.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
       Well,  one thing that Horacio h-  hadn't  mentioned is, um,
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      I mean, y- you were talking about
    
    
       uh  the same - the same sort of idea of just collecting a meeting and - and looking at it afterwards. But the - the thing that  I'm  interested in, and I'm probably the one who's gonna start doing the collection,  um,
    
    
      
    
    
       is e- is having this situation where people are talking to each other and talking to
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      a computer in the machine - in - in the room. 
    
    
      Um,
    
    
      and
    
    
      so that's probably - that's probably what -
    
    
      That's gonna be  @@ . 
    
    
      u-
    
    
      that's  certainly  what's gonna come out of, uh, of our group first.
    
    
      So - so are you gonna m- uh, i- is there gonna be some sort of  mark  for that?
    
    
      Uh um.
    
    
      And it -
    
    
       
    
    
      I mean, are they gonna say, "Computer, bring up a web page on -" or - ? 
    
    
      Well, so, you know, what we're - we're basically doing is - is waiting to look at the pilot and see what people wanna do but
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      it's going all be Wizard of Oz at first. So we're gonna let them do what they wanna do first and then see if we should
    
    
      Oh, I see.
    
    
      um, you know, subsequent things. Try to - try to constrain them or not constrain them. Or try - try to figure that out.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      I'm just thinking, from a discourse point of view it'd be very interesting to  somehow  mark
    
    
      Right. 
    
    
      
    
    
      "I'm talking to the computer".
    
    
      No, it has to be -
    
    
      
    
    
      has to be error complete. So the computer has to -
    
    
      Yeah, but you know what? They don't say when they stop.
    
    
      That's one of them -
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Pardon?
    
    
      They don't say,
    
    
      you know, "I'm done, Computer". They only mark the beginnings.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, yeah.
    
    
      Well, there might be a different  style  of, um - a different, actually, style of interaction. Yeah.
    
    
      e-
    
    
      So,  it - uh -  there are very -
    
    
      and it's all of these things -
    
    
      "Computer, show me a web page on X_," return. 
    
    
      i- i- is a g-
    
    
      It is exactly these things that I mentioned. This is - these are the main things that I'm interested in. Exactly these. When - when - do you know when you're starting and when you know you're ending.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Very interesting. 
    
    
      And actually Mari's -
    
    
      No, but - No but, y-
    
    
      But it's like, you know, if it really  was  an intelligent assistant sitting there you could say,
    
    
      
    
    
      "Oh, perhaps the computer could show us this." And you'd be talking to someone else but the computer's meant to be listening, and so saying,
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      "Oh, it means me." You know, "I shou-
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      I should - I should  do  something now."
    
    
      Are you talking to  me?   Are  you  talking to  me?  
    
    
      Yes, certainly.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      But there  might  be, uh, neat ways you can do this that are not natural but they become very easy, and that -
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      So like saying, like "Hal?"  
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      So.
    
    
      
    
    
      Mmm!
    
    
      Yeah. So. Right. So we wanna - we wanna look at  exactly  those sorts of things.
    
    
      I - I think, yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       Erase that part.  
    
    
      of - of us, at least in the  beginning,  is gonna have a number of different characteristics. It's not going to be natural. It's not gonna be a regular meeting. It's gonna be an artificial situation cuz we're gonna have to, you know, mock up some back-end.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Um.
    
    
      So the kinds of, you know - the kinds of speech is - the speech is gonna be slightly different. People are gonna be in an unnatural task. We're - we're t- gonna be trying to figure out how they're gonna -
    
    
       
    
    
      But you can  still  collect the multiple microphones in a similar way and transcribe, and th-
    
    
      But  -
    
    
      But we will have the, you know - We'll -
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      So the -
    
    
      we'll have all this - all the m- microphones set up all the same.
    
    
      That'd be  cool  actually.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I mean, that's the question. If - if we are collecting these at different sites, different kinds of tasks, different people,
    
    
      what is there that's gonna be  uniform  about this collection?
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      And part of it will be, well, this combination of close talking and uh,
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
       and  uh, environmental mikes.
    
    
      And - and then part of it will just be the data presentation, you know, maybe if - if we have common transcription standards and, you know, that it's all transcribed or
    
    
      there's - there's some integration of the standards thing.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      But I mean I u- u-
    
    
      
    
    
      as long as that makes  sense,  then it's  nice  to have a variety of  tasks,  right? To have sort of, you know, different -
    
    
      And - Yeah. And if your task is to just sort of, you know, generally do, um, summary and, uh -
    
    
      Yeah, I mean, I think the formats would be similar.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      and large vocabulary speech recognition over the thing, then it doesn't matter  that  much which,
    
    
      uh, that there's much a difference.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      But I think having the -
    
    
      the idea of the computer sort of in there forces you to create a -
    
    
      a log file format that can handle
    
    
      these other devices. I mean, you were talking about the Penn  and - 
    
    
      Right. Right.
    
    
      So
    
    
      I - I think it's -
    
    
      the  formatting  is really one of the biggest -
    
    
      issues. You know, not - not the f-  transcript  formatting but the audio formatting and the
    
    
      X_M_L, that solves everything. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      sort of
    
    
      figuring out how to  synchronize  all of these,
    
    
      um,  pieces. 
    
    
      That's right. We're gonna make -
    
    
      And what kind of software you can use for post-processing all of them.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Right. Someone will make some assumption that's different than
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      someone else. And then we suddenly won't be able to interoperate.
    
    
      Yeah, which i-
    
    
      Well, just - just the fact that people are making different assumptions is quite an interesting problem.
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      You know, it's quite an interesting issue.
    
    
      That brings up - Mmm.
    
    
      So that's something we should try to -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I- I'm not sure what - wh- I mean what's a good solution than that other than trying to keep in  touch  with each other.
    
    
      But - yeah.
    
    
      Well, i- w- if we're gonna have - if we're gonna - there's an opportunity to share tools, right? The- if we -
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      We could have like, you know, some periodic meetings, and like, uh,
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Yeah, or phone meetings, or even -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      phone meetings or something.
    
    
      Or meetings like  this  with -  about  the meetings. You know, with a -
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, I mean, meetings like this are good because we can actually record them.
    
    
      Yeah.  At the same time we contribute to the  database
    
    
      with a telephone.
    
    
      Yep,
    
    
      Yeah, contribute the data.
    
    
      
    
    
      absolutely.
    
    
      No, I'm serious.
    
    
      collection,
    
    
      and, uh.
    
    
      Even if we don't make any decisions we'll have a lot of data. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      That's right. 
    
    
      
    
    
      But it will be all documented. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Sorry. 
    
    
      Yes. 
    
    
      Yeah, actually we could do that at our site  too  even though that's not what I'm normally gonna be collecting, but there's no reason we can't collect that, and, uh, then you'd have a more -
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      m- your normal kind of meeting.
    
    
      So -
    
    
      When you're talking about your artificial meetings, i- they  are  gonna be  goal  directed, though. So they're gonna s- say, you're - you're having a meeting to do  this. 
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      
    
    
      They're going to be goal directed.
    
    
      You're supposed to - Yeah, you know. You're supposed to - you're - a budget meeting or something and you have a spreadsheet up there, and everybody has to sort of work out the - you know, some particular goal of where to p- allocate money. And they can t- ask the computer to
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      switch things around in different columns or something like that. But everybody - s-
    
    
      and acs- actually a- o- another characteristic is that we're only dealing with three people.
    
    
      Oh.  So that  will  be different.
    
    
      Um.
    
    
      Yeah. So.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      How is that? Three peop- total?
    
    
      We're gonna start with just three people, yeah.
    
    
      Is that the channel limitation cutting in?
    
    
      Um, I think it's mainly - It's  partly  channel limitation because we wanna - we wanna double mike everybody.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Um, it's also to a large extent, um -
    
    
      Oh, right.
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      
    
    
      And we have eight channels. Um.
    
    
      It's  also  I think, uh, e- e- sort of what came up I  think  when even Liz was, uh, involved a little while ago with - and Christine I think just in terms of the
    
    
      thinking of the subjects and trying to have enough people. We sort of wanted  to,   you know, encourage like everybody to talk, try to figure out some way that everybody would be able to participate and -
    
    
      
    
    
      So if -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      You're double miking everyone, so that's a close talking and a lapel, and then two environmental mikes, is that right?
    
    
      A g-
    
    
      Two  of  . Yeah.
    
    
      Yes, that was - that was the idea. Uh, but
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      I don't know, that was, you know, w-
    
    
      M-
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      we're not uh planning to do anything with - with all that like right  away.  So if there were - is there - you know, we - h- we're happy to take input on that.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Wha-
    
    
      Is it the three,  I see , mm-hmm.
    
    
      And  also,  I very much wanna find out about the, you know, the specs on the board that you have in the ma- in the - i- in the P_C_I card cuz I think we might wanna go with that.
    
    
      Well, if you ha- m- u- eh -
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      I wanna ask one question  though . So is - is it the same three people each time or a different three people?
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      No, no, we're ho- we're hoping to just bring in different groups of three people apiece.
    
    
      O_K, O_K. That's good.
    
    
      And do you have the same agenda, although there's  a  goal? Is there one goal or several goals?
    
    
      Because that'll would be more interesting data if there is like - 
    
    
      Uh.
    
    
      In a given - in a given meeting? 
    
    
      
    
    
      I mean, a budget meeting is a classic example, of where every comes in pursuit of a different goal.  
    
    
      Yeah, yeah.
    
    
      What we're try- what we're trying to do is not make it too - eh  you know, not make it too, um, ar- artificial. You know, not like say, "O_K, mmm, let's role play. Your, y-" you know, "you do this, you wanna -" but rather give them an actual task.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Well, there can be like a problem solution kind of thing where they would actually, you know - they have to come to one solution.
    
    
      So actually have -
    
    
      Yeah, and they all just have their own - they just happen to have their own opinions. And another possible thing that we're thinking of is something like, uh, you know, we have these regular Wednesday lunches and you gotta plan a menu, right?
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      S-
    
    
      So everybody has things that they like an- and, uh - 
    
    
      
    
    
      Well, some peo- people speak with their mouth full, you know that's a .
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah that -
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      But a lot of the -  No.  None of that.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      That is, uh.
    
    
      We - we - we've thought about doing -
    
    
      Delete that part. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       N- no eating during meetings.  Maybe salivating if you're thinking about the food, but it -  Um. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Right, right, right.
    
    
      Yes,
    
    
      or drinking.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       That's - 
    
    
      Y- getting - getting coffee on these is definitely a bad thing. 
    
    
      Not with  these  around. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      So - so, I - One question.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Oh, right. Yeah.  
    
    
      I - I mean, I haven't been in these,
    
    
      
    
    
      uh, 
    
    
      you know, preliminary de- decision meetings,
    
    
      but I don't know what's
    
    
      the 
    
    
      idea for the computer interaction. I mean, it's going to be a real computer, as in Wizard of Oz?
    
    
      Wizard of Oz.  
    
    
      O_K, so the idea is we wanna start off with a somewhat simple back-end and we're thinking of, um, agentifying an EXCEL spreadsheet and having s- like some kind of spreadsheet -
    
    
      Uh, what's -
    
    
      So basically, what - wh- people will see a spreadsheet and they can ask it to move numbers around. So
    
    
      we thought that would be a - be a useful kind of task for budget meetings or that kind of thing. So starting off - we would start off definitely with a Wizard of Oz task but it would be something -
    
    
      And so  it  will be a real computer recognition.
    
    
      Oh, O_K.
    
    
      So a real computer but a w- uh, someone driving it.
    
    
      
    
    
      Uh yes, but it would be something - uh but everything would be an agent. And so it just be - you know, we wouldn't have the recognition grammar to begin with. We wouldn't have the N_L grammar to begin with. But these are all components
    
    
       O_K, O_K, O_K. Uh-huh.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
    
    
      that are obvious to us how to build. Nothing - nothing that's sort of far in the future. It's just a matter of - of work.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      So somebody will be playing the recognizer and then other agents will be doing their task independently.
    
    
       Yeah.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      So,
    
    
      sort of - Right. Something that can be built up, you know, relatively quickly and makes sense how to do. So a fairly simple back-end.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Um.
    
    
      Good.
    
    
      Yeah, I - I think that's close enough to what we're interested in that it would t- it'd be useful for training
    
    
      Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.
    
    
      
    
    
      uh, the acoustic models, without any question.
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      Yeah, definitely.
    
    
      You p-
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      you plan to - to train actually models
    
    
      That's good.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Oh, absolutely.
    
    
      based on this data.
    
    
      Great.
    
    
       In th-
    
    
      Yeah, cuz if you don't the - the accuracy's gonna be horrendously bad.
    
    
      
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah, yeah.
    
    
      And this is just train- um, training them using the - um, the head-mounted data initially.
    
    
      
    
    
      So.
    
    
      
    
    
      Or, I mean is the intention to do some - som- Right.
    
    
      I think -
    
    
      Well, we'll definitely need to do  both. 
    
    
      
    
    
      No,
    
    
      I think the idea is to train on the, uh - on these mikes but use these to get the alignments that we're gonna train to, right?
    
    
      O_K. Understood. Right.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      You're not intending to do any -
    
    
      You said you weren't gonna - planning to do any beam-forming as such, but you're not intending to do any signal-processing or, uh -
    
    
      or, uh, uh, the sort of acoustic modeling of the environment or microphones, or anything else?
    
    
      I don't know.
    
    
      It - it really - i-
    
    
      Cuz that's actually  my  interest at the moment, so.
    
    
       
    
    
      It will really depend on if we have someone who really wants to do that. So.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Right, right.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       
    
    
      Well,  also,  I mean, I - I - I suspect that it may - we may not
    
    
      I-
    
    
      be able to get anywhere without doing something,
    
    
      Yeah, yeah.
    
    
      right? So.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Well it's -
    
    
      We may end up having to do that.
    
    
      
    
    
      just as an example, I- I've done some very simple digits recognitions where,
    
    
      uh, I said if I had known we were having this meeting I would have  done  this before,
    
    
      uh.
    
    
      Having people read digit strings cuz digits are much easier.
    
    
      That was Morgan.
    
    
      
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Um.
    
    
      Oh, that's really interesting.
    
    
      And just combining -
    
    
      just doing multis-
    
    
       We're starting off with digit stuff too  for - for - for our different - for - for this, um, endpointing stuff.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, of course.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      But, uh, just mixing
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      the -
    
    
      just doing multi-stream on the different mikes helped enormously.
    
    
      And I was a little surprised.
    
    
      Hmm, hmm.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah, so you - so you -
    
    
      Why - why is that?
    
    
      So you're having -
    
    
      Wh- why? I have no idea. Because they're a little different.
    
    
      Why?
    
    
      
    
    
      Sorry. When you say multi- multi-stream, you mean -r
    
    
       Hang on. You mean, you ne-
    
    
      
    
    
      The microphones are different?
    
    
      You mean, uh, bu- to - combining the -
    
    
      the posteriors on full band recognition
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      like from - from three different or four different mikes.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Cool.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      And that actually helped. That gave several percent improvement.
    
    
      That's interesting.
    
    
      Right, yeah.
    
    
      Absolute. So that, uh,
    
    
      I think just - just having stereo will help cuz they're a little different.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      You get a little - slightly different estimators and, uh,
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      uh, you combine  them   together, and you do a little better.
    
    
      So basically if you
    
    
      plan on really training -
    
    
      collecting a database uh for - database for training, I mean, you are talking about,
    
    
      you know, twenty thousand or forty thousand sentences.
    
    
      Things like  that. 
    
    
      Right, so that the -
    
    
       It's something like   tens  of hours -  tens  of hours of data, I think. Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      M-
    
    
      Tens of hours.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      So our initial plan for  ICSI  was to do forty hours.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      And then U_ W  is talking about doing an  additional  sixty to a  hundred  hours if they have the money.
    
    
       
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      That -
    
    
      If they can actually do it.
    
    
      Yeah, that's pretty -
    
    
      Really?
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      
    
    
       Mmm. 
    
    
      I mean, that's what they had said before but I guess that was more ambitious.
    
    
      That's -
    
    
      We were  thinking   something like, you know, ten hours to begin  with. It's about -
    
    
      
    
    
      They were gonna - There was a difference in the amount of money awarded from the beginning to e-
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      Well, the  other  thing  too  is, I mean, i- if - if you have the equipment then, i- i- it could be different. Then the recording is easy and maybe - maybe they -
    
    
      Um.
    
    
      But I mean, i- i-
    
    
      Yeah,  recording  it's easy.
    
    
      Yeah,  recording  is - Right.
    
    
      It's  transcription  that's a pain.
    
    
      
    
    
      It's transcription and processing, yeah.
    
    
      So - so - 
    
    
      Oh, the - Right. That's actually, that's the  other  thing. We weren't -
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Hmm?
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      O_K, but you have to put on a - You have to put on a mike. 
    
    
      So - so, clear- 
    
    
       I think we've run it - well, uh.
    
    
       Oh. 
    
    
      We're out of mikes. 
    
    
      I'd give you  my  mike.
    
    
      Not quite but -
    
    
      
    
    
      You can have my mike.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      It's not - we - we - it's a -
    
    
      It's not a speaker phone is it? 
    
    
      Don't - don't switch mikes. Don't switch mikes. That's  way  too confusing. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh, I'm not allowed to. O_K.
    
    
      We -
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Alrighty.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      we need to, uh.
    
    
      So, I mean, clearly i- if everybody's collecting data
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Uh.
    
    
      to train on, m- maybe we should do something -
    
    
      One thing I should point out, we were n- we were not planning on tra- doing transcription of the full thing right away, u- cuz that's not - I mean, I was initially interested in just the speech that was directed at the computer.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      And so we were not planning on doing the - transcribing the entire thing. But I mean, that's something to talk about.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      
    
    
      But if you had the data and we had -
    
    
      But perhaps the company - a company that might, uh.   Yeah. There -
    
    
      If you wanted - if you wanted to transcribe,  you have the  yes,  you'll be fine.
    
    
      a - a company.
    
    
       I didn't know whether I should name the company that may be providing us transcription or not.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      No.
    
    
      
    
    
      If you doubt, don't do it. 
    
    
      Cuz we're very naturalistic here.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      But it, um,  and there will be a lot of
    
    
      
    
    
      people to people talk in those meetings I bet with even three people, so.
    
    
      So what is the company? I heard a "sh-".  Ah! O_K. 
    
    
      So -
    
    
      I_B_M.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      So we've been - we've been trying -
    
    
      
    
    
      I guessed it from the clue, yeah.
    
    
      Ah!
    
    
      we've been trying to work with them for a while on these projects and they don't - it's hard for them to give us  money 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      but they - they seem to be willing to give us  time. 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      And so one of the po- potentials is for them to do transcription in exchange for access to the corpus.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      So basically it seems to be like, uh,
    
    
      I mean, if everybody
    
    
      w- e- u-
    
    
      was in the universities collecting data, we are, you are, I mean,
    
    
      sharing the data and making a bigger corpus is going to be,
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      It would be great.
    
    
      Mmm, mmm.
    
    
      Oh, yeah.
    
    
      you know, a benefit for  everybody. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yes, absolutely. I think that would be excellent.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      And, uh, it will really help the design too. It'll m- keep it from being too specific to somebody's set up or task.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Should we - should we interpret what he says? Morgan says - 
    
    
      Morgan said yes. 
    
    
       Oh,   do we - 
    
    
      
    
    
       That's right.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Morgan says thumbs up. 
    
    
      
    
    
      There we go. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       Right, right.
    
    
      
    
    
      Um, bu- but how much - how valuable - Given that you're interested in this computer-directed data and we're not gonna have any of that?
    
    
      Well, that's me personally. Our group in general as Horacio was saying is also interested in some of the same general issues.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I see.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Well, and I think that -
    
    
      Um,
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      and I'm also interested in prosody, um,
    
    
      use - you know, u- used over person to person stuff like segment and helping for segmentation and stuff.
    
    
      
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah, so we have some ideas there but not enough data to train. So - Harry, and Kemal and I probably -
    
    
      So al-
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      So actually having different
    
    
       kinds  of conversations is really helpful too because -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      to g- to make these models robust. You don't wanna train on just a few people's voices cuz then you'll just learn the -
    
    
      Mmm. Mmm.
    
    
      their prosodic patterns. That's not what we want.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      So - so how are you gonna get dra- ground truth on that?
    
    
      
    
    
      So - so we should -
    
    
      That is from the transcription and from the speaker s- segmentation.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      That's not hard.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      I think the hard part is getting enough training data and
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      nor- you also need normalization data. So you're sort of
    
    
      iteratively normalizing as you go through the -
    
    
       But anyway, what I was gonna  say  is that although we're not gonna have speech directed to a computer, my expectation is that the  acoustic  models will be very similar.
    
    
      So.
    
    
      The  language  models probably won't be.
    
    
      N- the language models c- Yeah.
    
    
      Actually the acoustic may not be either.
    
    
      
    
    
      So, it's -
    
    
      Really? Oh, sure.
    
    
      Yeah, I - if it's Wizard of  Oz  I think it will be.
    
    
      If they know that -
    
    
      Yeah, if it's very good, that's true. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      If it makes mistakes it'll be different though I think it -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      On the language model  we're -
    
    
      Hmm,  right.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      The language model  will be  - certainly be different but -
    
    
      uh we're - we're gonna be using the same thing that we've done in the past which is, you know, we need a natural language grammar written anyway. It's written in unification
    
    
      grammar framework.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      um, but with context free grammar, power, and so it's
    
    
      just changed directly into something the recognizer recognizes off of directly with - with no, um,
    
    
      And you're gonna hand - c- hand-code that?
    
    
      It's - it's - it's hand-coded. Because we need - we  need  to write the natural language grammar anyway to understand.
    
    
      So it's - it's a small, you know, ATIS-sized type task.
    
    
      Oh, I - I uh sure, sure, sure, sure. I see.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      So, yeah, that's - that's the way we've been approaching it.
    
    
      Right, if you wanna interpret it you  uh  need to do -
    
    
      Eh if we - if we're ge- yeah, we - you know, if we're gonna be able to
    
    
      do that anyway.
    
    
      interpret it then - I mean, if we're not gonna be able to interpret that then it's not gonna do us much good anyway to recognize it.
    
    
      So we might as well go directly from the natural language grammar.
    
    
      Is it - is it gonna be like an H_P_S_G kind of grammar?
    
    
      It is a unification base, it's not - it's not as - as theoretically bound as H_P_S_G in particular, although the couple of people that we have working on it have H_P_S_G backgrounds.
    
    
      I see.
    
    
       So what's your time frame look like for -
    
    
      
    
    
      doing meetings, actually starting to  record  some?
    
    
       It's all up to when I have free time.  Anybody else want to work on this by the way, Horacio? 
    
    
      I guess
    
    
      Yeah.  I mean,
    
    
      
    
    
      except -
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Well -
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      well,  indeed.  I mean, most people, you know, after this evaluation and conference   should be working
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      on these type of things.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      At least, you know
    
    
      Well I know they're all working on mediated spaces but there's a lotta aspects o- e- to that - to that project.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, yeah, but -
    
    
      but eventually - I mean,
    
    
      will be people working on uh kind of recognition aspects and, uh, you know,
    
    
      and - and - and in core technology.
    
    
      So I mean, recognition technology and also core,
    
    
      you know, algorithms,
    
    
      et cetera. And for those people to have these data will be,
    
    
      you know, the best way to,
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      
    
    
      you know, develop the systems to an .
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Well the - the reason I'm asking is that it's certainly better to get in  early  with standards, and data formats, and conventions.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, definitely.
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      So probably, uh, on the -
    
    
      Um.
    
    
      Well, so we haven't even - you know, we haven't collected a byte yet so.
    
    
      Right. That's actually why I called this meeting, cuz i- I mean, you're both working on it and with, you know, different sampling rates, and  these  silly things like that.
    
    
      Well, yeah, it's a - it's ex- excellent, excellent.
    
    
      Mmm, mmm.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, that's right. I mean, just - just - just
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      So -
    
    
      agreeing on a sampling rate and a number of bits, and, uh, header formats and all that.
    
    
      And we have the same sampling rate.  One - one thing we  do  know is that we're - we're all producing NIST
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Sampling rate in the  end.  Yeah.
    
    
      What?
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh,
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      
    
    
      Sphere files in - in, uh, eh in the standard  format.   Sixteen bit, sixteen kilohertz. So at the  end  we're all - And the amazing thing is that even - even, you know, the entire way  through  we're actually using some very, very similar stuff.
    
    
      NIST headers. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Sixteen bit, sixteen kilohertz? Eh, good good.
    
    
      Bits, sixteen-K_, yeah.
    
    
      O_K, s-
    
    
      Big endian, little endian? 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Well I just made that up but,
    
    
      And so tha- yeah.  So,   Yeah, it's coincidence that it's very fortunate cuz - Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      um. 
    
    
      Well, but that's - that was coincidence, right? 
    
    
      But that -  yeah,   yeah. But you have different na- you - we're gonna have different, you know, hardware and - and -
    
    
       Yes, that's right,  not,  but - 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      We actually have, yeah, quite similar hardware as it turns out.
    
    
      It's similar but not quite the same.
    
    
      But it - but it -
    
    
      O_K, so -  so.
    
    
      Which is ver- it's - it's very good, yeah. Um, so we're actually -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      So the bit we're a bit deficient in as we -
    
    
      So I - I think probably the  biggest  thing
    
    
      
    
    
      would - Well, no that - that wouldn't be true. If you're not gonna transcribe it  yourself, 
    
    
      
    
    
      then you're not gonna care too much about our transcription  conventions. 
    
    
      Actually that's - the  transcription  conventions - I was talking about this with  Jane  - it's really important to people at least like  me 
    
    
      Well -
    
    
      
    
    
      Uh -
    
    
      
    
    
      who wanna know, um, certain
    
    
      
    
    
      Right of it.
    
    
        uh, who are looking at aspects that are sort of -
    
    
      they're not words but they're structural things you're trying to recognize.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      And also I guess for the speaker.
    
    
      People interested in the speaker
    
    
      separation because what you call a turn
    
    
       
    
    
      and the end of a turn, and that - it - it's
    
    
      
    
    
      horribly confused if you don't sort of -
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      It's inherently hard. And so you have to make some
    
    
      simplifications and different people make different simplifications, and then you can't compare them at all, which is what the literature is sort of like now.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      So, um, and then there's the issue of recognizer dictionaries, and non-standard forms, and things like that that have to be mapped.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      So "gonna" versus "going to" and that kind of thing.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      I mean, all those issues yeah I'm sure we - I mean,  like I say. I'm - I'm personally not
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      They're not hard but -
    
    
      interested in those for my particular aspect of the project but S_R_I in general is - is the - Yeah.
    
    
      but we definitely will be interested in some language and dialogue.
    
    
      And s- I don't know, maybe we  will  end up transcribing stu- if Hor- if Horacio wants, you know, wants that done, maybe that'll be - maybe we'll end up doing that.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      So.
    
    
      Well -
    
    
      And U_W is also probably gonna be interested in that too, the dialogue kinds of things.
    
    
      So, i-
    
    
       Well, so it's a - 
    
    
      you know. 
    
    
      so it seems like, um, if you and Jane -
    
    
      Is - is Morgan nodding his head?
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      O_K. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      So if you and Jane keep - keep in touch about
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       transcription  conventions, that would be very helpful.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, that's originally - We should thank Jane because that's how I originally - she showed me some transcripts and I thought, "Wow,
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I mean, it's kind of amazing too that, you know, the transcription tool we just converged on the same - All these things were very, very similar. It's -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      this is great".
    
    
      Oh, yeah.
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      Yeah, yeah, to study using the same thing.
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      You were also thinking about the same tool?
    
    
      That's interesting.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      We - we - we were gonna use the same tool. We - we set up that tool already, yeah.
    
    
      Wow!
    
    
      But what if you had like
    
    
      written the s- the Tcl kluge or something,  and then  both  done the same -
    
    
      Already!
    
    
       Yeah. 
    
    
      Hmm. That's right.
    
    
      Can  you  do that?
    
    
      Well, the - I mean, and in some ways that does change the, uh, the economics of doing that.
    
    
      I mean, it's -
    
    
      Right. It's much more worth while to do if someone else is gonna use it. Although again if this now named company is the one who's gonna do the transcription,
    
    
      But, um.
    
    
      Hmm! Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, that's right.
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. But we still - yeah.
    
    
      I sus- I suspect they have in house tools that they'll end up using.
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      But you still need something that can display these channels.
    
    
      
    
    
      That's interesting.
    
    
      Right, we need - we need some kind of browsing.
    
    
      e- e- better than what
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      it can do, I mean.
    
    
      It's -
    
    
      And then I guess who is the contact at U_W? Like
    
    
      Morgan? Morgan doesn't have a microphone but is it -
    
    
      That's alright. He can talk anyway.
    
    
      He's allowed to speak, he ca- yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      is it - I mean Mari and -
    
    
      Well, he could be reached - he could be reached by the far field, couldn't he?
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah. No, I - it's just that there's no .
    
    
      Mari or - or - or Katrin, or Jeff, or -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Oh, at U_ W.  I'm sorry.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah. I mean, both - I think both Jeff and Katrin have some time on this.
    
    
      On - on the transcription issues?
    
    
      No, on the p- on the DARPA project, who would be sort of contacts
    
    
      for -
    
    
      Let's start off assuming  Mari  and if -
    
    
      Mari.
    
    
      And if Mari's too busy then -
    
    
      if it ends up -
    
    
      Yeah, then she'll tell us who to
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      O_K, yeah.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      talk to.
    
    
      But I think  Mari. 
    
    
      And the I_B - the I_B_M,
    
    
      as long as I'm talking, lemme - 
    
    
      Hmm, . 
    
    
      
    
    
      The, uh, the I_B_M thing, uh - i- they basically have said "yes".
    
    
      So, just to -
    
    
      because you were probably talking around it because you were concerned it was secret.
    
    
      I was. 
    
    
      
    
    
       But  it's not - not really secret. Basically,
    
    
      there's a proposal in to Mari - to uh, tsk  I_B_M from Mari and us
    
    
      uh, for some funding. It's actually a pretty small amount even if it gets funded.
    
    
      Uh, but the most appealing thing in it to us was, in a way, that they're gonna do this transcription and also potentially give us some equipment.
    
    
      Uh or loan us some equipment we could use.
    
    
      And it - it occurred to me one day that - that,
    
    
      uh, we didn't have to wait for their proposal process to go through because, since they're interested in  supplying  this to us, we could just ask them for  that  since it didn't quote-unquote  cost  them anything.
    
    
      Uh, and, uh, they said uh - Mike Picheny said "sure".
    
    
      So, eh, as far as I know we are
    
    
      
    
    
       on  to have them do it. It's just a question of people on our end and people on their end talking about what are the mechanics of it and then it will - it will just happen.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      So we - we  had  never mentioned, you know, S_R_I stuff  too,  but I think they're just interested in - as long as everybody's fine -
    
    
      
    
    
      excuse me for covering things that we might have already talked about, but as - a- as long as everybody is fine,
    
    
      with the data being basically free to the people involved,
    
    
      um, at  least,  we can talk about being far more open than that, which we probably  should  be, but
    
    
      at - at the very least, all the people involved, uh,
    
    
      at any level can have access to all of it so you guys can have it, U_W can have it, we can have it, and I_B_M can have it, and
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      lots to discuss further.
    
    
      
    
    
      I don't think we have any problem. I mean, we had certainly in our - you know, the proposal that we tried to make to N_S_F, we were assuming we would distribute this through the L_D_C.
    
    
      No, yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, I - I mean, 
    
    
      this - this is something that re-
    
    
      L_D_C is what we were thinking too.
    
    
      re- requires a  bootstrap.  I mean, there is no L_D_C database. There is, at  least  we have to share the data, I mean.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah, so we have no problem with that.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      That's the bottom line, uh.
    
    
      I - I mean, I think eventually L_D_C could be  very  interested in it, especially if you have a tool that can do this. I mean, there  isn't  one.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      And - and the data. So maybe it'll - we can actually -
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      You can  sell  corpora eventually to the L_D_C and you can get time, student time, to clean up the corpus and things.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      So that s- that requires more thinking and discussion but - but certainly amongst everybody who is helping one another, w- w- why not? And I -  yeah .
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      So.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      So we should talk with
    
    
      Mike Picheny about, you know, after this m- yeah, get some other briefing later about other things that were said, but uh, assuming that it is what I think it feels like, having walked in  ten minutes ago,
    
    
      
    
    
      uh, it seems li- I c- I can't imagine that he'd have any problem with getting even more data than -  than he thought he was.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      I wanted to ask one question about the - the nature of the design. Th- Given that the overlaps are up - up uh, where the difficulty comes, in  a   bunch of a- areas,
    
    
      It's terrific.
    
    
      um, whether it would be useful to have  some  of the sessions have like an additional rule where if a person, you know, the - that there's someone who recognizes people to speak or something like that to cut down on the - so you - then you have the meeting context, you have multiple channels, you have the microphones n- varying the way you want  them   to vary,
    
    
      
    
    
      but you'd cut down substantially on the overlaps. It wouldn't be f- for  all  meetings but whether maybe just sprinkled through there once in a while, something like that might be useful or not. Just wanted to raise that.
    
    
      I don't know.
    
    
      I mean, it's difficult because you want it to be
    
    
      real speech, right? And also it's not clear how well people can even adjust to even
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      adjust to that kind of rule.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      I mean, s- it - tho- those - those kinds of things are sorta the kind of things that we were thinking of - of  trying,  cuz we are having - we do have a more artificial  set-  environment again.
    
    
      But if there -
    
    
      Robert's rules.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      We're trying something totally new having people speak to the computer.
    
    
      I don't think we talked about that in particular cuz we didn't - we haven't done any pilots, we haven't seen this,
    
    
       incredibly difficult data of overlapping.
    
    
      But this is
    
    
      uh, Christine Helverson, who's working on this with me from the s- um, aspect of user, you know, usability and stuff, would, y- you know -
    
    
      sh-  she's  interested in these sorts of things. What - what  can  you ask people to do that, um, that they  can   reliably  do and without too much, you know, cognitive load,
    
    
      um, that can help things out, or, you know, those sorts of issues. So,
    
    
      I don't know. Maybe it's something that could fit easier in - in  our  context than in a general meeting context. I don't know.
    
    
      
    
    
       Well I think that -
    
    
      Well, what I can say is that wha-  sometimes,  you know, if - if - if we were to have this kind of coordination thing,
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      some - some of the overlap is due to someone wanting to claim the floor at a certain point
    
    
      without knowing that other people have the same desire at the same point in time. And if - and if you were to have someone who was like a moderator, then you raise your hand, the moderator  would  say, you first, you know, or yeah, press the button.
    
    
      
    
    
       Just have a button.
    
    
      
    
    
      And ring the buzzer. 
    
    
      And - and I think, you know, there are always gonna be backchannels, I think that's natural and lovely. But these - these overlaps that are due to people n- not knowing other people wanna leap in at the same time and - and  wanting  to coordinate - you know, I think that, uh, it could be lessened.  Not  eliminated entirely.
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-mmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      Hmm. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      I don't know.
    
    
      There are certainly f- formal meeting settings where that's what's happens, y- that
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      you know, Robert's rules of order and all that. 
    
    
      Uh, so that's not something we had  thought  about before but I think it - it - it certainly is another
    
    
      type of meeting that could be done.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Ha- have you been continuing the practice of collecting connected digits and so forth?
    
    
      Uh, no, I didn't. I didn't know we were gonna be recording this meeting, so I didn't.
    
    
      We - no -
    
    
      No, I meant the independent - in the other meetings.
    
    
      Yeah, in general yeah.
    
    
      Yes, in the other meetings we have.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      And they've been collecting digits too.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      
    
    
      So that's another thing we should  talk  about, is making sure that we're doing it in the same way.
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      We -  For a - t- for a completely different reason I assume but -
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      So I - I -
    
    
      And - and not within a - not within a big room. Just, uh.
    
    
      Yeah, I mean, in our case it was just that, uh, since everything - e- everything on every level about this task is difficult, we thought we'd s-  make one part of it not difficult for at least  some  of the data, so that - 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      That's a good idea.
    
    
      Yeah, if I had  known  and here we have all these new speakers, I could have gotten lots of  digits  in but -
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      But sorry, so you connect - you collect digits
    
    
      in conversation or - or individ- 
    
    
      Yeah, yeah. We - we give people a list of digits and they have to like put them into their discussion, like say, "Five, one, seven, seven, three." 
    
    
      No, no, I have people read  them.  
    
    
      Uh.
    
    
       Seven.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       I was thinking -
    
    
      You- you're encouraged to, you know, just utter digits once in a while. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       Never mind, I'm getting attacked.
    
    
      You say, "hey, by the way,  eight! " 
    
    
      
    
    
      No we have  set-  sets of digit strings that we've got from T_I-digits I guess, and the idea was just that we would have - have some data with different speakers with far-field microphone effects, so that we could look at far-field versus the close mike or .
    
    
      
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      So you don't need the meeting for that. You can just sit me in this room and set up all the microphones. Right, O_K.
    
    
      No, but as long as we have this same  space , it's just amortizing the people  the  time that they're there.
    
    
      But you need the room and the set up.
    
    
      Right, right. O_K.
    
    
      Yeah, we're doing digits - yeah, we're not doing digits in the - in the room set up at all. We're doing it for a complete- I mean,
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      one of the specific things I'm interested in is knowing - um, is the open mike issue. When you're talking to the computer, knowing when you're done speaking.
    
    
      And so I'm loo- interested in - in -  well , in- interested in looking at prosody. Um,
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Oh, cool.
    
    
      So that's the -
    
    
      and so we're just having - we're just doing lists of digits to see when people pause to know,
    
    
      you know, "there was a big gap in time here but, they" - you know, we can tell prosodically they weren't done, so.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, so that's a different deal.  Here  it's just - we have the same group of people. You're  amortizing  their time, but also,
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      you have the same room setup, you have the same microphone setup, and - but now you have s- you have something we actually  usually  can recognize. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      I - I think that's a really good idea. To always - yeah.
    
    
      But - but there is -
    
    
      but there is also this fascinating prosodic thing that goes on because you - what we - we have is like these lists of ten digit strings or twenty digit strings and they're like one - one to five or one to seven digits.
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      And people read through them. And you know, we're saying, well we won't to be able to separate them so please pause between but it's very - people don't like  doing  that.
    
    
      And so there  is  this  prosodic  thing which is - which is indicating when -
    
    
      whe- the pauses between these digit strings. And then when they finish, the actual - the whole  sheet,  there's this nice, wonderful - yeah, phrase .  And it -
    
    
      Mmm, mmm.
    
    
      Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, d-
    
    
      Yeah, right.
    
    
      Nice falling, yeah.
    
    
      Declination, yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      If -  you   definitely shouldn't use your last sample. I mean, people that do prosody work, they add a few at the end because otherwise people will -
    
    
      Right.
    
    
       So.
    
    
      
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Oh, I hadn't thought about that.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Oh right. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I hadn't even thought about throwing out the last couple. Definitely should.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      No, but  that  -  that  is  beautiful  because then you can get this F_ zero  floor
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      for each of the speakers.  Just  from  that. 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
       Oh, right, just look at the very last -  look at the very end. 
    
    
      Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      You don't necessarily throw it away, but - 
    
    
      
    
    
      Don't throw it away but don't use it in your training.
    
    
      Yeah, yeah. Treat especially -
    
    
      
    
    
      Your - your junk is our, uh,   training  data.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Cool.
    
    
      No, that's a really good idea to have some standard - I mean, especially if a- the different sites can do something like that.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       And -
    
    
      You'll at least be able to see whether difficulty across site is due to,
    
    
      you know, the lexicon version, uh. 
    
    
      Right, right. There'll be a common - That'd be great. Yeah, that's a good idea.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      That - that was - that was actually Jerry's idea and the first time he told me I thought it was terrible cuz I thought, "Oh, look we've done all this stuff with digits, we don't wanna be messing with that again." but -
    
    
        Funny.  
    
    
      then after I had a chance to sleep on it, I went, "Wait a minute"  it's - it's a really good idea.

      I - I just extracted exactly the same ones, so.
    
    
       Have we all memorized these? Maybe we know them.

      Since you know what - you know what the transcript is you don't have to type it in, you just have to segment it.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.

      Using X_- X_Waves, Tcl-T_K, Perl, and maybe some C_ programs too.

      O_K.
    
    
      I - I print them out a- a- as I need them. So what I should do is just print out a whole stack and leave  them   up here but I haven't done that.

       Well, but i- 
    
    
      
    
    
      Ha- wha- I mean, we could just make - make numbers up, can't we?
    
    
      It's - it's a different task. It's a different task than read.
    
    
      Yeah, yeah.
    
    
      You - you do it differently if it's sitting in front of you and you're reading it than if it's not.

      I - I - we can get digits. I mean, a- as you said, we don't have to be in a meeting.
    
    
      And so if we're short on digits I can just, you know, capture people in the hallway, drag  them   in here, and have  them   read digits for me.
    
    
      
    
    
      As long as they come to our h- hallway more often but -

      Alright.
    
    
      I wanted to ask about also the  air  conditioning. Are - uh, is there a plan to - to turn the air conditioning  off  in some of these meetings or is it always gonna be on?
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, it's way too cold in here.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      We should do that cuz y- you  can  turn it off on that - that thing right there and it makes a huge difference.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Well,
    
    
      You also gain noise from the projector as well, isn't it? Yeah, yeah.
    
    
      the - the hum we hear right now is actually the  projector,  not the air conditioner. The projector is  much  louder than the air conditioning.
    
    
      A- all right. 
    
    
      But the projector, yeah. This is the first time we've done it with a projector.
    
    
      Huh.
    
    
      Yeah, but I was just thinking, he was showing it - on what he showed us on the web site, you could see the contribution of the air conditioning. And I just wondered if that was gonna be sometimes  clear .
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      But the projector's not part of your
    
    
      meeting or - or - or  is  it? Do - is this normally gonna be on during collection?
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Um, no, not normally, not for our meetings. I - at least
    
    
      very few of the ones we've done have we had to do anything on the computer.
    
    
      No?
    
    
      It - 
    
    
       
    
    
      For ours it  will  but we have a rear projector, so it's in a separate room. 
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      
    
    
      It  actually  gives you a way of calibrating  microphone  position in a  way.  Doesn't it?
    
    
      That's right, from volume. That's interesting.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      For volume, it's a point source pretty much, yeah.

      Digit strings, yeah.
    
    
      That's right.
