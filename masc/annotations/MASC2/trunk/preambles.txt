      me011 left early (11 minutes into the meeting).
   fe004 arrived late (15.5 minutes into the meeting),
   and did not read digits.
   
   Channel 3 mic was on, lying on the table, but unused.
   
   Channel 8 had a huge amount of static noise toward the
   latter part of the meeting.  (Andrea mic)
   
   Laptop presentation.
   
   Some Discourse highlights:
   Nice me010 / mn015 interaction at minute 22-22:26
   (misunderstanding and clarification)
   Nice me010 / mn015 overlapping/duetting
   minute 26:26-27:14
    
    
    
  




  
    
      First 38.911 seconds of recording is blank on all channels.
   
   No digits recorded.
   Gain may be too high.
   Powerpoint presentation.
   
   fe016 recorded the meeting and is heard, unmiked, at the beginning.
   She is not a regular participant in this meeting.
    
    
    
  




  
    
      me010 arrives at 6:29.
   mn015, me003, me012 read digits at beginning
   of meeting
   laptop presentation
   PZM 4 was turned about 90 degrees (holder broken)
   fe016 (recorded meeting) talking in background at beginning,
   not regular participant in meeting and not miked
   
   In addition to fe016, when she sets up the meeting, there are
   two other voices, on the tape recording played:  fe046 and fe903.
   
   The main speakers are off-mike more often in this meeting than in
   other meetings.  The utterances are transcribed to the extent possible
   but sometimes not fully audible:
   1) fe016: instructions
   2) Wizard and Subject on the tape-recorded data which gets played
   3) mn015: when he has his mike half off for unknown reasons for
   a couple of utterances
   4) me010: for several utterances before putting on his mike
   5) me003: when his mike cuts out at 41:23
   
   Body of the meeting:
   0:16 to 2:42 digits
   3:26 to 6:29 social discussion while they wait for PI to arrive.
   9:50 to 22:26 mn015: plays recording from wizard data collection
   20:42 to end of meeting me003's progress so far in developing the
   data representation
    
    
    
  




  
    
      PZM4 was out of its styrofoam holder.
   me010 did not read digits.
   
   Channel 2 (mn015) has a lot of distortion.
   
   Meeting actually ends at 1 hour 3 minutes, i.e., at 16:03
   rather than 16:11.
    
    
    
  




  
    
      - No digits in this meeting.
   - Two new participants: fe046 and me045
    
    
    
  




  
    
      Channel 4 (me012) not turned on until 5:43 into the meeting;
   that means that digits on chan 4 were read with mike turned off.
   
   Channel 2 (me010) mike cuts out at 1:02:50 (at point noted in
   transcript)
   
   Channel 5 (mn015) mike cuts out at 1:06:40 (at point noted in
   transcript)
   
   Discussion continues, unmiked and untranscribed, for some time beyond
   this point. Since Channel 2 and Channel 5 are major participants in the
   discussion and cannot be reliably heard from the other close channels,
   it seems wise to truncate this meeting at 1:02:50.
    
    
    
  




  
    
      End of meeting (and transcription) is at 53 min. 14 sec.,
   which is 30 seconds before end of recordings.
   
   Potential problem with a loose jack on channel 8.
    
    
    
  




  
    
      The room was not freed up until just after 4pm, so folks started
   their meeting during set-up.
   They may not have read the digits due to the late start. (No digits.)
   fe004 may have come in later than the others.
    
    
    
  




  
    
      The recording volume seems to have been too high on several channels.
   Distortion whenever various people laugh.  In addition,
   me010's channel gets distortion everytime he stresses a word.
   
   Channel 5 (mn036) is either improperly adjusted, or his mike is off.
   
   Channel A (fe004) malfunctions at 7 min., 26, and from
   then on, she is heard only on Channel E and is transcribed
   as "unmiked" - if she is heard at all - starting with minute 33.
   (She seems to have a cold, judging from voice quality.)
   
   Only fe046 and fn050 read digits.
    
    
    
  




  
    
      me012 came in at about 4pm (turned on his mic when came in).
   
   No digits read.
   
   Meeting actually starts at 1 min. 22 sec., so there's no transcription
   before this point.
   Meeting actually ends at 43 min. 22 sec.  Close-talking mikes
   are turned off at that point, so transcription stops.
   
   Channel 1 (me012) has a lot of fumbling noises on the mike, as
   if constantly readjusting it.
    
    
    
  




  
    
      No digits read.
   fe004 arrived late.
   Channel 0 (fe004) seems to have been recorded at too low a
   volume, or else not well adjusted (not near her mouth).
   Channel 5 was on and recording, but not worn by anyone.
   
   Channel 4 has a lot of breaths.  At the initial part, there
   is also a lot of microphone saturation.  May have been
   recorded at too high of a volume.
   Coughing on both Channel 0 and Channel 4 at numerous
   points.
   
   Linguistic notes - this meeting contains a lot of nonce "ish"
   words (is this meeting culture for this group?); also
   "cognitive linguistic-y" and "construction grammar-ally".
   It also has a lot of humor and feigning of various
   emotions for humorous effect.
   Discourse notes - these people fill in each other's utterances,
   and leave fill-in gaps for others to do so more often than
   most meetings.
   Extra noises - lots of squeaking in the backgroun on mn015's
   channel when he is writing on the white board.
    
    
    
  




  
    
      Power flickered sometime during meeting.
   
   No digits read.
   All mikes except channel 0 are active at 1 min 30 sec.
   Channel 0's mike becomes active at 6 min 34 sec.
   All microphones seem to be shut off between 38:14 and 38:20, for
   some unknown reason.
   At minute 52 almost all mikes are shut off except channel 1,
   but conversation continues, imperfectly audible from the
   non-close mikes.
    
    
    
  




  
    
      No digits read.
   
   Linguistics - some great meta-level sentences at 17:41, which might
   be confusing for automatic mapping (if the quotation marks aren't
   used).  At 21:15, me045 uses "quote" for marking a meta-level
   sentence.
   
   fe004 comments on discomfort from microphone (find "hate").
   
   Discussion of stress, accent, topic, and info structure, and
   how they're approaching these topics in their project (at 26:00).
   
   Interesting novel compound at 28:40 -
   "[C]ertain W_H words bring - you know, sort of automatically
   focus in a, you know, "I don't know the identity of this thing"
   kind of way on certain elements."
   
   Interesting separated words:  "you're hopeless-uh-ly lost anyways"
   "hypothe-thetically".
   
   Novel words: "sort of speech act-y information structure-y"
   "some of them seem more inherently static, O_K, like a container
   or sort of support-ish."
   
   Many quoted utterances have disfluencies embedded in them. For
   example, "the big - the tall dark man", you know, "walked into the
   room".
   
   Rhetorical reversal causes amusing exchange 57:30 to 59:00.
   
   Comment on the transcript, at 1 hr. 2 min., "I'm *sure gonna
   read the *transcript of *this one. So. {laugh} But the, uh, -
   {laugh} But it's too bad that we don't have a camera. You know,
   all the pointing is gonna be lost."
   
   Humorous reference at 1 hr. 4 minutes to something they
   can't discuss on tape.
   
   Complex utterance, "But whatever. Yeah, no, no, no no. No, by
   all means, right. Uh, sure." at 1:11:31.
    
    
    
  




  
    
      Simultaneous digits.
   
   They play part of a tape recording, transcribed without close mike.
   This involves three additional voices: unknown subject fe901,
   computer-imitating voice xe902, and fe046.
    
    
    
  




  
    
      No digits read.
   
   Channel 5 seems to be shut off (or extremely badly adjusted)
   from 9 min. 38 sec. to 12 min. 47 sec.  During that time,
   me010 is only marginally audible.
   At 27 min., 53 sec., fe004's "OK" is audible from other,
   but not on her own close-talking, microphones.
   
   Discourse notes -
   Very funny non-serious "argument" at the beginning of this one.
   Prior to minute 2, lots of surprise reactions (to images on screen).
    
    
    
  




  
    
      There is lots of noise on channel 8.
   
   The reported gain is just a place-holder, since the original gain was not
   recorded.

   There are some audio issues in this meeting which resulted in channel 0
   being a bit longer than the other channels. As a result, the channels are
   not exactly synchronized.

    
    
    
  




  
    
      - Just after 440 seconds in, there is some garbling of buffers for about
   10 s, which was accompanied by some logged error messages.
   Although recording recovered and continued, the downsampler state may
   have been skewed, so that the synchronization between channels
   changes across this boundary.
   - At the very beginning, me025 is barely audible on channel 2, but can
   be heard on other mikes.  He becomes strong on channel 2 from
   "any way you like", at just before minute 1.
   - Channel 8 (the earmount) was recording but unused.
   - Between about times 20:30 and 22:30, fe008 leaves the meeting room
   (still wearing her head-mounted microphone), goes down to her office on
   a lower floor, collects some books and papers, and returns to the meeting
   room. Doors opening and closing, keycards beeping, etc. are all clearly
   audible during this trip.
    
    
    
  




  
    
      - no driver glitches reported to console.
   - apparently me022 had the microphone around his neck.
   - me904 is audible briefly at the very beginning, unmiked.
   Not a regular meeting participant.
   - some comparative data regarding acoustics of wearing mike around
   the neck are found in the opening minutes, as some people start
   out wearing it around the neck and then switch.  me011 says he'd
   prefer that people wear them on their heads, but that some people have
   complained about comfort.  Brief discussion about headset design.
   - some comparative acoustics of having the lights on or off, and
   of having the fan on or off (around minute 10-12).
   - at around 43 minutes, me028 walks to the kitchen across the hall
   from the meeting room and gets a cup of water from the water cooler
   there (while still wearing his microphone headset).
   
   - Linguistic notes.
   At 10:46, me011 (channel 0) has an utterance which sounds
   fine, but involves "a .. ad-hoc", i.e., shows that the rule of "a"
   before word beginning with vowel is not absolute, or that it can at
   least be bent in presence of pause after the article.
   Novel expressions:
   At 14:56, me022: "That's sort of a beside-the-point point."
   At 28:16, me028: "A little double-blind-ear kind of thing." (based on
   "double blind" studies)
   
   - this was a very informative and amusing meeting, which also included
   a lot of odd vocalizations (e.g., singing schwa, intentionally speaking
   in monotone), and challenges to the set up (e.g., turning the
   head back and forth with mike neck-mounted, putting pages on top
   of the PZM, bobbing up and down above the PZM while talking, turning
   fans and lights off and on), and changes in vocal quality (mock
   delight, sarcasm, mock worry, etc.), and lots of kidding around
   (while still getting a lot done).  Excellent audio quality.  This
   would be a good one for drawing examples from for demos.
    
    
    
  




  
    
      me001 read digits, but didn't speak otherwise. He left early.
   mn017 left early.
   
   Some transient (impulsive) noise seems to occur on channel 5.
    
    
    
  




  
    
      fe016 left the meeting about half-way through.
   She did not read digits.
    
    
    
  




  
    
      mn017 (channel A) left early, and did not read digits.
    
    
    
  




  
    
    
  




  
    
      On this recording, fe016's volume vascillates quite a lot, as she
   moves her head. Most likely, she wore the headset around her neck for
   this one.  Many examples, if anyone wants a sense of the variation in
   acoustic volume from this factor.
    
    
    
  




  
    
      mn017 left at 29:00. He did not read digits.
   
   A number of microphone spikes on channel 8.
   
   fe905 enters briefly to deliver some paperwork.
   She is recorded unmiked, but is not a regular meeting participant.
   
   In this meeting there was a lot of discussion of recording
   methods, and then reports by mn017 and by mn005.
   
   Interesting discourse events include one remarkably dense
   section of overlap and one remarkably long embedded utterance,
   both noted in transcript.
    
    
    
  




  
    
    
  




  
    
      mn017 left early. mn009 read digits on his mic.
   mn014 did not have a head-worn mic, but hardly spoke at all.
   fe016 left early, and did not read digits.
    
    
    
  




  
    
      Transcription begins at 1:38 into recording.  Conversation earlier is
   segmented, with pieces marked simply as "pre-meeting utterance",
   during the period that the recording equipment was being set up
   and debugged.
    
    
    
  




  
    
      Some spikes on channel B.
   
   Channel 8 and channel B seem to have been recorded at low volume.
    
    
    
  




  
    
    
  




  
    
      Spikes on channel B, the Andrea mic.
   
   First meeting where simultaneous digits were tried, but no one read full
   digits sets.
    
    
    
  




  
    
      mn017 left early, and did not read digits.
   
   Channel 4 has a lot of microphone spikes; perhaps recording
   volume was set too high.
   
   Channel 5 was having trouble keeping his microphone
   adjusted.  This is discussed at 39 min., 40 sec.
    
    
    
  




  
    
      fe016 and mn005 arrived late. (~12min, ~15min, resp.)
   
   Digits were read simultaneously.  No digits by me001 (perhaps due to
   microphone problem).  Digits transcript numbers were not read for two of the
   speakers: L-47 for fe016 and L-42 for mn005.
   
   Channel 8's microphone has significant microphone noise, becoming especially
   bad starting at 41 minutes, 46 seconds.  This is the beginning of the
   microphone's death; after a stretch of bad noise, nothing more is heard
   on this channel except for occasional minor noise -- no further speech,
   laughter, etc. from the speaker (including no digits).
    
    
    
  




  
    
      mn017 and me001 did not read digits.
   
   Problems with channel 1's microphone, beginning around 15:10 - 15:20.
   The microphone produces occasional static noise
   until 24:26, when it becomes totally silent.  From 24:48 - 25:57,
   mn014 is only audible in the background (not the close mike).
   At 27:28, me011 and mn014 detect the battery problem.
   At 27:33, there is a noise spike on mn014's close mike.
   mn014's channel comes back on after that.
   
   The variations in volume on mn017's channel suggest he was
   wearing the microphone around his neck rather than head-mounted.
    
    
    
  




  
    
    
  




  
    
      me013 left early, and did not read digits.
    
    
    
  




  
    
      - Meeting actually doesn't start until 1:51. Before this, the transcript
   is somewhat incomplete, being transcribed mostly from the PZMs.
   - Due to lack of enough digit forms, the L-138 form was
   xeroxed and 6 participants (minus mn017) read the
   digits in synchrony.
   - fe016 left out some early digits when reading (laughing).
   - mn014's wireless microphone was OK at the start of
   the meeting but lost battery power by the end.
   == The mic goes out at 35:43. ==
   However he contributed almost entirely to the first half
   of the meeting.
   - Recording started slightly before all mics were turned on.
   - fe008 came in slightly later than the others.
   - mn017 left early (before digits were read).
   - The gain on fe016's channel was much too high, so her line
   frequently saturates when she's speaking.
   - For the first half minute of the recording and the last
   half minute (before people put on mics and after they
   removed them) speech is transcribed without benefit of close mics.
    
    
    
  




  
    
      fe016 and mn017 arrived late, left early, and
   did not read digits.
   fe016 enters at about 13 min, mn017 at 12:26;
   fe016 exits at about 43 min, mn017 at 49:16.
   Digits were read simultaneously.
   The gain on me011's line was a little high, so he had frequent
   clipping throughout.
    
    
    
  




  
    
      Digits were read simultaneously.
    
    
    
  




  
    
      mn017 left a little early, and did not read digits.
   
   Periodic spikes and distortions on Channel 4.
    
    
    
  




  
    
      mn017 arrived slighly late.
   
   A lot of distortion (spikes) on Channel 5.
   
   Discourse - interesting example of subtle frustration, signalled
   by breaths, laughs, etc., from minute 6 to minute 24.  Resolved
   at minute 24.
    
    
    
  




  
    
      Digits were read simultaneously.
   
   fe016 wrote "I didn't have mic on right initially.
   Doesn't fit very comfortably on my ear".
   This situation allowed an exceptional amount of ambient
   noise.  At times, therefore, her speech was nearly or
   completely indecipherable.  Sometimes the noise made
   it difficult to determine whether she was speaking at
   all.
   There is a lot of mike noise on this channel (A) as she
   works to get the mike reasonably positioned, but this
   settles down a lot at 5:33.  Thereafter, there are only
   occasional stretches of bad mike noise (e.g. around 22:20-40).
   
   me001 (channel 4) fiddles with his mike frequently, so the
   gain varies considerably, resulting in some stretches of
   very pronounced breathing and laughs saturating the line.
    
    
    
  




  
    
    
  




  
    
    
  




  
    
      me018 arrived slightly late.
   Digits were read simultaneously.
   
   me011 re-adjusts gain on me018's channel (ear plug mike)
   about 3 minutes into the meeting.
    
    
    
  




  
    
      me011 (channel 8) left early.
   There is a brief interruption by mn906, an unregistered and
   unmiked speaker (not a regular participant), calling fn083
   out of the room re: telephone call.
    
    
    
  




  
    
      me011 recorded the meeting and is heard briefly, unmiked, at its start.
   
   End of meeting is at 1 hr. 40 min. 20 sec. (2 min. 16 sec. before end of
   recording).
    
    
    
  




  
    
      me907 is audible at the very start of the meeting, but
   leaves immediately and does not have a channel or close-talking mike.
   
   me011 is audible at the very start of the meeting, but
   leaves immediately and does not have a channel or close-talking
   mike. He set up the recording system.
   
   Neither me907 nor [me011] is a true meeting participant.
   
   The actual meeting ends at 3007 seconds (50 min. 11 sec.).
   The recording continued, though, until 5841 seconds (58 min. 41 sec.),
   with some of the participants discussing things which are inconsistently
   audible in the background. The files have been truncated at 3007 seconds.
    
    
    
  




  
    
      me011 is heard fleetingly during this meeting.
   (He is unmiked, not true meeting participant.)
    
    
    
  




  
    
      Channel 9 (me006) appears to have a loose connection. For example,
   while reading the digits, he pops in and out.  This causes extremely
   loud spikes.  However, his digits are clearly audible on PZM1 (channel E).
   For this reason they are transcribed as un-miked when there are trouble
   spots.
   
   me011 is audible prior to digits task for several utterances, but
   doesn't have a close-talking microphone, and is transcribed un-miked.
   Not a regular meeting participant.
    
    
    
  




  
    
      Other participants:
   - me011 is audible off-mike when he set things up and tested
   them at the beginning. Not a regular meeting participant.
   - me034 is audible off-mike when he arrives at minute 35.36,
   but only just barely.  His utterances are not fully audible on any
   other speakers' close mikes, nor on channels 6, B or E, but
   maybe they will be recoverable from 7, C, D, F.
   
   Other aspects:
   - me013 had a noticeable cold, verging on laryngitis (very low
   voice with less than usual frequency variation)
   - There is a lot of paper shuffling throughout mn007's presentation,
   probably by all participants. From the audio, you get the impression
   that everyone had a copy of the handout, that the handout was of a
   table with many columns perhaps on multiple pages which needed to be
   compared, and that everybody was leafing through their copy of it
   at various points.  This kind of noise seems very difficult to isolate
   to a particular channel.  Since it is so pervasive, it is also not
   systematically marked through the meeting.  On the other hand, it
   does have very distinctive visual properties (short vertical spikes)
   in the waveform - i.e., doesn't look like voice at all.
    
    
    
  




  
    
    
  




  
    
    
  




  
    
      No digits recorded.
   
   "To separate the ears" is spoken in unison on 2 channels
   at 47:21.  Unusual event!
    
    
    
  




  
    
      No digits read.
   
   Lots of spikes on Channel 8 (me006's channel).  It totally
   blacks out around 13 min 4 sec (at which point, his speech is only
   audible on other channels), but it comes back later in the meeting
   (at which point, he is transcribed on the close-talking channel again).
   Also lots of spikes on Channel B (me026).
   
   There is a short patch in channel 1 which sounds technically
   garbled somehow:  14:06.715 - 14:10.278.
    
    
    
  




  
    
      Channel 1 (me018) has a persistent rattling noise everytime he
   speaks.
   Channel 5 (mn007) has a lot of random noise spikes during the
   first four minutes.
    
    
    
  




  
    
    
  




  
    
      me006 (channel 4) is drinking something during the
   meeting, so there are a lot of sip, swallow, put down glass
   noises on his line.  Not marked exhaustively as they were
   too numerous.
   
   Parallel conversation around 41-42 minutes in:
   me018 + me013 and mn007 + fn002
   -- a good example of this phenomenon.
    
    
    
  




  
    
    
  




  
    
    
  




  
    
      mn007 joined the meeting about half-way through.
   
   Lots of spikes on me018's channel (channel 5).
    
    
    
  




  
    
      Channel 2 has mike noise in the form of "pops" periodically,
   when he uses words which begin with "p" (e.g., "people").
   Channel 4 has mike noise usually intermittently, from being
   bumped or readjusted.  There are many uncertainties regarding
   what she said, despite careful checking.
   Channel 5 has mike noise intermittently throughout.
    
    
    
  




  
    
    
  




  
    
      Speakers on channels 2, 3, and 4 do not read digits, because
   there were not enough digits forms for all to read (as stated
   at minute 57:13).
    
    
    
  




  
    
      mn052 enters at 4:22 and there is a fair amount of mike noise
   on his line for a minute or two as he gets settled.
    
    
    
  




  
    
    
  




  
    
      me026's microphone (channel 2) died at 2819 seconds (approx
   46 minutes into the meeting).
   He gave a long report prior to this point, which is salvagable,
   but his digits were audible only as background speech on other channels.
    
    
    
  




  
    
      The last channel (5) was really hard to check because even at full
   volume, the sound level was very low, so may have missed some
   backchannels or not heard things correctly.
    
    
    
  




  
    
      Channel 0 seems to be extremely low volume.
    
    
    
  




  
    
      Channel 4 has a number of instances of "nose whistle with
   inhale", i.e., breathing through nose makes a slight whistle noise.
    
    
    
  




  
    
    
  




  
    
      - This was the first time we had a meeting after the installation
   of the video projector, which was on the whole time - look out
   for the fan noise from it on the PZM mics, particularly PZM 3 and
   PZM 4 which were directly below it.
   - me013 arrived at 37 min. 43 sec., and sat silently until
   45 min. 53 sec.  He didn't wear a microphone.  Spoke from
   the far end of the group, closest to PZM 4.
   - channel gains are not the true settings, but fictitious values made up
   to satisfy the required formats.
   - me011 let mn038 try on me011's microphone
   from 5:43.15 to 6:00.63, during which time mn038 is audible on
   both channels and me011 is not close-miked on either channel.
   so warning: BE CAREFUL TO PRUNE THIS SECTION OUT of any analysis
   requiring pure channels
   - some microphones were worn around the neck
   - during minute 6 there were really two conversations taking place
   simultaneously
   - no digits read
   - Channel B mic was on, but unused.
   - Channel E and channel F were recorded, and are probably the Crown tabletop
     wired microphones (Mic="c2", Transmission="u1"). However, the information
     wasn't provided, so this is just a guess. The audio files exist, but the
     Channel section below makes no mention of these channels.
    
    
    
  




  
    
      me011 recorded the meeting and is heard briefly (unmiked) at
   the meeting's start.  (Not a regular participant.)
   
   Digits were read simultaneously.
   
   Some "dead" time at the end of the audio. Should be truncated
   at 1 hour, 4 minutes, 20 seconds (1:04:18).  (This is about
   4 minutes after mikes were turned off, but the conversation continued
   -- without benefit of close-talking mics -- for several minutes and has
   been transcribed from the tabletop microphones.  This addendum represents
   a continuation of content-related discussion, which could be useful for
   other purposes.)
   
   fe008's voice is mildly cold-ridden (mild laryngitis).
    
    
    
  




  
    
      me011 recorded the meeting and is heard briefly (unmiked) at
   the meeting's start.  (Not a regular participant.)
   
   fe067's mike seems to black out somewhere between 1:14:21 and
   digits (which are only audible by listening to me070's channel),
   and are transcribed as un-miked.
   
   At minute 49, fe008 steps outside the meeting room (still miked)
   to check with the front desk about extending the meeting longer than planned.
   
   Novel lexicalization:  fe066: "to get re-used to that keyboard"
    
    
    
  




  
    
      In addition to the 8 miked speakers listed, there is a brief
   interruption by me908 around 37:00, and me032 joined the
   meeting in the last few minutes and made a few un-miked, but
   transcribed, remarks.  mn017 was neither miked nor
   transcribed, and does not seem to have contributed.
   No digits.
