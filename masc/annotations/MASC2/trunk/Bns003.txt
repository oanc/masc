      Is this a virtual meeting, or - ?  
    
    
      Uh, they're partici- 
    
    
      O_ K. 
    
    
      Are we on?
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      
    
    
      O_K, thanks  again. 
    
    
      O_K, we can start?
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      O_K. Thank you, Adam. I will call you then when we are  ready . I believe, maybe one hour, in  that  sense.
    
    
      Just give me a call.
    
    
      O_K. Thanks. 
    
    
      O_K, welcome to our next meeting.
    
    
      Um  I have couple of points we should discussed.
    
    
      
    
    
      One is related to the proposal,
    
    
      Michael, please can you
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      close the door?
    
    
      Thank you.
    
    
      And, um
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      furthermore, as most of you know I will leave in
    
    
      tenth of December, I think we should discuss how we proceed in the meantime,
    
    
      
    
    
      because I get,
    
    
      I would like to say, different signals from Siemens,
    
    
      I believe, in the meantime it's a higher probability that I  will  return,
    
    
      but based on the pro- uh, procedure to get a J_one visa and the I_P six six
    
    
      it will be -
    
    
      I would like to say, earliest stage will be end of  January, 
    
    
      so that means  we have to get over six weeks and -
    
    
      
    
    
      Then furthermore I would   like  to  know  the  status  of  everybody.  I know for sure, O_K,
    
    
      
    
    
      um   Miguel,   you will  have your plans
    
    
      for this, uh, ongoing process, uh,
    
    
      concerning  your  work.
    
    
      O_K, from you it's
    
    
      definitely  clear,  in principle.
    
    
      
    
    
      O_K, for Michael,
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      what are  your  current plans and
    
    
      Dietmar, maybe you then, also.
    
    
      What  we  have discussed, in principle, concerning the ongoing process with U_ -
    
    
      
    
    
      U_S_A_I_A and also this, uh, your current work,
    
    
      and from my point, it seems to be clear that I will go back
    
    
      definitely at tenth of December,
    
    
      and, as I mentioned before,
    
    
      probably will be -
    
    
      more than fifty percent, I would like to say, that I will be come back
    
    
      to
    
    
      get  the freedom
    
    
      to  launch   here the project in the sense in whatever kind of form
    
    
      and get, in principle,  paid 
    
    
      by  another  project within  Siemens. 
    
    
      So  the point is how  long  I will stay. I believe, a couple of months definitely
    
    
      and based on the success, I think that's always an ongoing process to go back to -
    
    
      uh, to  Germany  for a couple of weeks and then come here and - and go on with - with this work and - 
    
    
      so that is  my current opinion, concerning how Siemens deal with - with my, uh, ongoing effort.
    
    
      
    
    
      And, furthermore, I would like to - First of all,  thanks  to
    
    
      uh   Dietmar  because he started to use a
    
    
       testbed. 
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      
    
    
      Eh
    
    
      in principle, in his spare time.
    
    
      Yeah!
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Uh I will - So - so the first,  uh
    
    
      uh,
    
    
      box, this morning.
    
    
       I  will set up, definitely, in my spare time, in the evenings and the weekends the  second  box,
    
    
      
    
    
      and I'm looking for  two other volunteers
    
    
      who are setting the  third  and the  fourth  box.
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      But wh- wh- wh- what are the box?
    
    
      A box is a  s- P_ C. 
    
    
      P_Cs. P_Cs.
    
    
      But what w-
    
    
      Equipped with - with - we should equipped it with - with Linux or maybe too with Free B_S_D,  I doubt - I don't know
    
    
      
    
    
      Well the first
    
    
      stop, - the first thing  the most, eh, complicated is to fit them with the
    
    
      and we'll -
    
    
      removal -
    
    
      removable - um, hard disk.
    
    
      
    
    
      And now we have an  expert. 
    
    
      But it's -
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      So the first computer I had to -
    
    
      um 
    
    
      
    
    
      the
    
    
      Oh,
    
    
      what's the right word?
    
    
      
    
    
      I had to
    
    
      put everything out
    
    
      to - to put the  removable hard disk in and - and it's -
    
    
      Yeah, to remov-
    
    
      So that you can pull eh the - plug in the removable hard disk to the I_D bus and - and O_K, maybe it's a little bit -
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Yeah, it's -
    
    
      but i- but it's not - not, um  very, uh  difficult or something like that.
    
    
      Uh-huh,
    
    
      So you just have to -
    
    
      And -
    
    
      Why you are laughing?
    
    
      
    
    
       I ju-
    
    
      I don't know, I cou- I s- I didn't see him,
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      so I don't  know  what he did. 
    
    
      
    
    
      I know in the meantime it's  running,  and I will definitely set up the  next  one.
    
    
      Uh!
    
    
      
    
    
      So  Wilbert  will set up the second computer.
    
    
      Yeah, though my idea - maybe you eh can equip it with a-
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      I don't know what your time constrain- whether the time constraint allows you to set up one with - with Free B_S_D, for instance. Yeah.
    
    
      You know, I - I can -
    
    
      I can build, eh, any computer uh  you n-  - installing whatever.
    
    
      O_K, uh-huh.
    
    
      It's needed, I mean, I
    
    
      will enjoy doing it. So.
    
    
      Do you find the time?
    
    
      
    
    
      That's O_K for me.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Maybe also to uh support your -
    
    
      No promises.
    
    
      No promises? 
    
    
      No.
    
    
      and even maybe to - to, uh  put your I_G_M_ P  stuff on it.
    
    
      Eh
    
    
      No promises.
    
    
      
    
    
      No promises.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      No.
    
    
      
    
    
      Ah, he's very hard to  sell . 
    
    
      So it's about one hour to put this, uh  hard disk in and
    
    
      a further hour to, uh -  Well,
    
    
      two or three hours
    
    
      
    
    
      to install the operating systems.
    
    
        Nee ,   because then the  network  is still  running  then.
    
    
      
    
    
      Could we wait until the network is  running?  Because currently it's not possible,
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      At the moment.
    
    
      uh, based on certain  fire  wall constraints. I believe David is, uh, currently  working  on that.
    
    
      
    
    
      to
    
    
      set up the fire wall, and he's not an expert for that
    
    
      and when I get the signal I will ask one more time.
    
    
      Nah, but nevertheless thanks to Dietmar that he  @@ .
    
    
      Did the networks have  internet  connectivity?
    
    
      
    
    
      Yes, we have, eh, for - for secure  socket, 
    
    
      and, uh  for  web  access,
    
    
      the fire wall is open. That's all.
    
    
      And - But currently it's not  working,  right?
    
    
      
    
    
      Right, um  On Friday when I installed, um 
    
    
      uh 
    
    
      Linux the first time
    
    
      
    
    
      I
    
    
      got  access   to the  local  network here,
    
    
      um, but not to any machines outside of, uh, I_C_S_I.
    
    
      
    
    
      And, till  Monday  there's no access at all to any machines,
    
    
      also not to inside machines.
    
    
      
    
    
      But then,
    
    
      uh 
    
    
      So, I think it's related to the work, um  they've done on Sunday here and I sent -
    
    
      But normally you should have access to th-
    
    
       all  the internet, r-
    
    
      to  outside. 
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      Yeah,
    
    
      You have
    
    
       Full. 
    
    
      internet  outside  access,
    
    
      but no  telnet  and not R_login or whatever kind of things, you know.
    
    
      A  restricted  in.
    
    
       Not.  
    
    
      Huh. 
    
    
      Not a - no F_T_P.
    
    
      Yeah,  F_T_P  yes.
    
    
      H-
    
    
      But no  telnet. 
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Uh  because you can -
    
    
      The - the - the point is that we will use it, as it is uh described several times, that we will use it as a  local   network,  in principle,
    
    
      but it doesn't make sense to use certain kinds of
    
    
      uh, media transportation f- to put some stuff you need
    
    
      from your P_C or your  L_S   to this, uh - uh,
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      uh, to this  testbed,  you know.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      So
    
    
      you download it,  if that  s- must be possible from the network, but normally
    
    
      it should be used as um -
    
    
      uh
    
    
      for demonstrations or to figure out if you have a scenario where you have to use  more  than,
    
    
      uh, one box
    
    
      which you have on your desktop,
    
    
      cuz that is the primary, uh uh   reason  for this testbed.
    
    
      So,  definitely  you have to have
    
    
      web access
    
    
      to download the necessary files.
    
    
      Hmm-hmm-hmm.
    
    
      So and then furthermore, one more thanks to Claudia.
    
    
      He  did a  lot   of work and I could only
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      
    
    
      Ah, the messages. Oh.
    
    
       pass her  some advices and some discussions with her concerning the web pages.
    
    
      And now we are, in  principle,  in the state we have to do it with a  project 
    
    
      area. But they're also some contributions from  you  guys requested.
    
    
      Um
    
    
      and the  alumni   page, in principle, we have to,
    
    
       you know ,
    
    
      but it's primarily my job, I believe,
    
    
      uh, to set up so that it is, uh adjusted really to the people
    
    
      who are  worth  to be
    
    
       alumnis   -  alumnis,    yeah.
    
    
      Is it  " alumni"   - "alumni"? 
    
    
      I'm -
    
    
      "Alumni".
    
    
      "Alumni".
    
    
      
    
    
      I'm not sure how to pronounce this word.
    
    
       Aber das wird jetzt geaendert.  
    
    
      
    
    
      Huh?
    
    
       Das wird geaendert.  
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      And, um -
    
    
      But, um
    
    
      I think  everybody  should
    
    
      take a look to the web pages,
    
    
      and inform Claudia if something, uh, has to be
    
    
      improved or if there's some  comments   or
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      uh
    
    
      He's laughing all the time. Why?
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Uh because it is - you know, that's  very  important
    
    
      maybe now- not for  us 
    
    
      but maybe for our successors and maybe somebody will come back once a day or send some students or some colleagues or whatever.
    
    
      
    
    
      So, my point of view - I will
    
    
      doc- I will
    
    
      documented everything
    
    
      when I will leave here in the sense that
    
    
      potential successor as a  group  leader
    
    
      can hook  in  with these things
    
    
      and that
    
    
      these  web  pages will be  updated   every  time when it is  necessary.  We tried to do it,
    
    
      so that it must be at  least  updated  only  when  really  major changes happen.
    
    
      So that means somebody's  leaving  the group,
    
    
      uh, somebody is  joining  the group, a  new  project is started,
    
    
      but, uh, the effort should be minimized as possible.
    
    
      And, so  please 
    
    
      take a look to the web pages
    
    
      and
    
    
      I have announced in the  project  area
    
    
      the major  headlines. 
    
    
      And especially,  Wilbert,  maybe you can write something
    
    
      about
    
    
      yours?
    
    
      I call it, I believe, "Multicast" and then "Development deployment",
    
    
      eh, for - for source specific multicas- maybe a few lines, maybe a picture.
    
    
      And something like  that  should be added to U_S_A_I_A? O_K, that's  my  stuff.
    
    
      And
    
    
      um
    
    
      then
    
    
      the
    
    
      next point is then this
    
    
      active routing stuff?
    
    
      
    
    
      Um
    
    
      I would like to discuss it  before,  but
    
    
      you were busy.
    
    
      Yeah, O_K.
    
    
      And so -
    
    
      um, I believe, it must be adjusted
    
    
      to the current activities
    
    
      a little bit more.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      And, um
    
    
      I - I think it doesn't -
    
    
      It is not  worth  to discuss it  now  because nobody raised it before.
    
    
      Yeah,  I  think so.
    
    
      And, uh, so l- let us have a  bilateral   discussion  afterwards. 
    
    
      I would - what I would  like  to have is
    
    
      that
    
    
      um,
    
    
       your  contributions is related to certain kind of things happened  here. 
    
    
      And that means really to the project proposal itself
    
    
      and also maybe to the U_S_A_I_A architecture, in that sense,
    
    
      that at certain stages,
    
    
      cuz it's a  general  architecture, certain stages maybe to future
    
    
      
    
    
      mobile
    
    
      core networks,
    
    
      that it is related
    
    
      to these kind of things.
    
    
      Um, having - uh, I - what I have in mind is
    
    
      that things should not be started from the end system.
    
    
      That's my principle concern,
    
    
      because  that  will  never  be  happen,  from my point of view.
    
    
      It should be started as the  edge  device,
    
    
      so that it cu-  certain  kind of  mechanism,   whatever, 
    
    
      is enabled between the
    
    
       ingress  edge device and the  outgress  a- edge device,
    
    
      because it  will  be at the certain stage
    
    
       I_P  based in the future generation telecommunication  networks 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      That's O_K.
    
    
      before its  goal .
    
    
       Fuel  it to the - over the internet, and b- between  these  both  boxes, 
    
    
      I can assume
    
    
       uh  because the mobility happens there
    
    
      as a normal natural thing
    
    
      and the forwarding process and the  routing  process should be no more  separated,  from my point of view.
    
    
      And to have  there  a certain kind of intelligent mechanism,
    
    
      that the packets can be used
    
    
      to set up  the routes  because they have all the information.
    
    
      They  know  where they have to  go  because I_P addresses are still there
    
    
      Hmm-hmm-hmm.
    
    
      and -  within  the packet. I mean, how can this use,
    
    
      uh, within this area, and how this area is then aligned
    
    
      to the more  traditional  routing within the
    
    
      internet backbone  itself. 
    
    
      That's my question.
    
    
      And I think that is good a research area, then I think there's a lot of -
    
    
      I'm not a e xpert  at  all  for this.
    
    
      But I - I - I believe, there's a lot of potential for that.
    
    
      And we should discuss it maybe
    
    
       bilateral   afterwards.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Yeah?
    
    
      So, one more time,  everybody 
    
    
      should take a look to the web pages
    
    
      and from Claudia, at the general remarks
    
    
      and should write
    
    
      based on the, uh,
    
    
       headlines  in the  project  proposal
    
    
      the
    
    
      um
    
    
      things what still happened,
    
    
      the things what they have  still  in mind
    
    
      uh  so that we can update these last  you  know   present the last major
    
    
      part of the web pages.
    
    
       The  pages are already on the web?
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Yes,
    
    
      Yeah, yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      It  is. 
    
    
      you can now access it normally with maybe W_W_W I_C_S_I Berkeley  EDU,  
    
    
      So there are some gaps.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      and
    
    
      so.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Yeah, so there are some gaps left and,
    
    
      I don't know,
    
    
      you - Maybe you can also read through the - all the text which is on the web pages cuz I'd like to change the text a bit
    
    
      cuz
    
    
      sometimes it's too long, sometimes it's too short,
    
    
      
    
    
      maybe the English is not that good,
    
    
      so
    
    
      
    
    
      um,
    
    
      but anyways -
    
    
      So I tried to do this  today 
    
    
      and
    
    
      if you could do it  afterwards  it would be really  nice  cuz I'm  quite  sure that I can't find every,
    
    
      like, orthographic
    
    
      Uh, there - there - there are couple of comments I - I have about the web pages.
    
    
      mistake in it or something.
    
    
      
    
    
      Good.
    
    
      One is - is the, uh, I think it's Joe's, uh,  graphic,  I think it should be better.
    
    
      Yeah, yeah, yeah, the graphics are too bad.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Maybe you are working at it.
    
    
      I know.
    
    
      You are  definitely   right. 
    
    
      It  was  in a good shape, but
    
    
      
    
    
      O_K,
    
    
      
    
    
      And then maybe the -
    
    
      
    
    
      it, uh, then we disturbed.
    
    
      the I_C_S_I logo could be -
    
    
      
    
    
      could be -
    
    
      I can't change
    
    
      
    
    
      something with a logo.
    
    
      could be, uh -
    
    
      No, it is  just,  uh -
    
    
      
    
    
      Maybe we can - we can,
    
    
      uh,
    
    
      translate the white color into transparent color
    
    
      
    
    
      so it will  get more natural.
    
    
      Yeah, O_K.
    
    
      Good,
    
    
      
    
    
      It's just a suggestion.
    
    
      yeah I ju-
    
    
      an-
    
    
      another thing is I'd want to
    
    
      get a link on the logo so that you can
    
    
      come from the logo to the 
    
    
      To the   home  page.
    
    
      ICSI web p- home page 
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      back.
    
    
      That's - that's O_K.
    
    
      So.
    
    
      That's - these are th-
    
    
      some things I have to do.
    
    
      Yeah, and if you have something which I should
    
    
      put on the web page for you, so
    
    
      
    
    
      yeah, some pictures will be nice, a few sentences will be nice, and
    
    
      yeah, it
    
    
      depends on how much time you have.
    
    
      
    
    
      And then
    
    
      the page for inf- about -
    
    
      So, some information for
    
    
      people who are
    
    
      new comers or,
    
    
      
    
    
      I don't know a good word for it, should we use uh
    
    
      "new comers" or -
    
    
      So, with somebody who is new, arriving here,
    
    
      or
    
    
      
    
    
      wants to -
    
    
      to, uh, send an application?
    
    
      Newbies.
    
    
      S-
    
    
      Huh?
    
    
       Newbies. 
    
    
      Newbies?
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, O_K.
    
    
      So,  there  I have to add some information, I don't know, I t-
    
    
      I  tried  to set up everything by today
    
    
      for this page cuz I've started with this,
    
    
      um, if you have any kind of ideas what was important for you
    
    
      then just let m-
    
    
      cuz I have some
    
    
      
    
    
      points like
    
    
      um 
    
    
      I don't know
    
    
      f- yeah, like Pacific Bell, like uh, long-distance carriers, then like uh, cars and car insurances,
    
    
      health insurances -
    
    
      So, health insurance is k- something I can only say for German
    
    
      
    
    
      people.
    
    
      Hmm-hmm-hmm.
    
    
      So maybe
    
    
      I don't know if this is different in Spain.
    
    
      That would be
    
    
      fine too,
    
    
      to have some information, or in D-
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      nnn
    
    
      
    
    
      I-
    
    
      Holland. I don't know.
    
    
      I will take a look and I will tell you something.
    
    
      Yeah, so how - maybe how  you  did it or
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      whatsoever.
    
    
      O_K, I will send you some because I have something in mind.
    
    
      So
    
    
      yeah,
    
    
      then what else
    
    
      
    
    
      did I have?
    
    
      
    
    
      Then
    
    
      
    
    
      another point's like, uh, what about the bank,
    
    
      
    
    
      uh, so, transferring your money from Europe t-
    
    
      over here, what is the cheapest way or what could you recommend or something.
    
    
      
    
    
      um 
    
    
      another point 
    
    
      yeah, and then
    
    
      there's -
    
    
      there's another point like going out in Berkeley or what to do in Berkeley or in
    
    
      the
    
    
      neighborhood.
    
    
      This - a lot of this stuff is not networking group - N_S_A,
    
    
      uh, restricted.
    
    
      No, I know.
    
    
      Yeah, but nobody  do  that, you know.
    
    
      I know.
    
    
      But there's nothing like this on the -
    
    
      on the
    
    
      ICSI page as far as I know.
    
    
      So,
    
    
      that's the point. We  discussed  it still a couple of weeks or months ago.
    
    
      Uh, the point is normally it  is  an I_C_S_I task anyway.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      M-
    
    
      But
    
    
      Yeah, but a- at least then it should be -
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      
    
    
      mmm,  I  think be, uh, I_C_S_I  part,   and not network  restricted. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Well, th- they have uh, a - a white booklet,
    
    
      you know, probably -
    
    
      Yeah, that is from nineteen ninety-one or nineteen ninety-two, you know.
    
    
      Yeah, but it's not in the -
    
    
      This is not on the web.
    
    
      A- 
    
    
      And this is  not  on the web, and the - the - the -
    
    
      No, no, no.
    
    
      I - I just - I
    
    
      people
    
    
      normally -
    
    
      that's was my - my, uh -
    
    
      In fact the Pacific Bell phone was not working, for example
    
    
      when I tried the -
    
    
      the phone on this booklet it was not working.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      But the thing is that maybe
    
    
      
    
    
      this could be on  a starting  point or - or   if - digest  
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I don't know, maybe I talk with  Jane  about this. If we can
    
    
      use this information,
    
    
      I don't know,
    
    
      somewhere
    
    
      on the ICSI home page  too. 
    
    
      M- move it on the normal  ICSI, 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       I_C_S_I .
    
    
      Maybe.
    
    
      Maybe every group has somewhere hidden, uh 
    
    
      We can  do  that.
    
    
      a gro- uh
    
    
      deep 
    
    
      Yeah, but the  point  is that nobody feel  responsible  for that.
    
    
      outgoing -
    
    
      And if it's -
    
    
      Yeah, but eh - but  my  point is that it should not be under the  networking  group
    
    
      It's a common -
    
    
      Yes,
    
    
      thing. eh - But -
    
    
      Uh, yes, I  see  there your point.
    
    
      That's right. But  if  it is under the networking points, the group leader is  responsible  to
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      get up to date information. I believe, we are the  group, 
    
    
      where the people are,
    
    
      uh, changing
    
    
      much more faster to  join  the group and to  leave  the group as other groups.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      And, so, the  most  problem
    
    
       as - as of ,
    
    
      uh, it's likely that uh, the people here in  this  group needs this information
    
    
      um, much more  f- uh, often as - as  other  groups.
    
    
      But -
    
    
      b-
    
    
      But that could  still  be
    
    
      applicable if you put it under the  ICSI  site if you take the  responsibility  for that.
    
    
      Yes, I  see  th-
    
    
      Yeah, I talk to Jane about this.
    
    
      Uh,
    
    
      Yeah, but we - we can  do  that.
    
    
      So I think th- I think both  arguments  are not an ar-
    
    
      are arguments against having this under the normal  I_C_S_I  page.
    
    
      Or only the networking, uh, page.
    
    
      But the  problem  is, are you allowed to change anything on the
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      general ICSI server?
    
    
      No, this is why I have to talk to Jane.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, that's -
    
    
      yeah, that's a -
    
    
      So you may need  just  a link from the  main  ICSI page to the N_S_A page.
    
    
      
    
    
      We have the - we have the directory structure,
    
    
      of the real  UNIX  tree.
    
    
      in compliance and in  accordance 
    
    
      with what you -
    
    
      with the structure of the  web  pages.
    
    
      And, um, that means, uh,
    
    
      
    
    
      the group leader normally do not have  access   to the general  web  pages.
    
    
      He has  access   to the N_S_ A  pages.
    
    
      And, um,
    
    
      but I think that's an  administration  problem and that everybody  agrees  that the information
    
    
      
    
    
      page  must   be 
    
    
      on the  general,  on the  highest  level.
    
    
      O_K, I have no  problem  with that.
    
    
      But, uh
    
    
      But -
    
    
      but I think we discuss if still -
    
    
      your argument is, uh, I think it
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      we have to
    
    
      have the right to change it.
    
    
      So if there's anything changing in
    
    
      insurances or something -
    
    
      something like that,
    
    
      
    
    
      that we have  access  
    
    
      to this
    
    
      page further on -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      to chan- to make any changes.
    
    
      Yeah, but  this  is not a problem at all, I -
    
    
      I mean, if y-  you  are coming from Germany and you  know  that there is something changed with the health insurance, then you send Jane an email like "Could you please change this, blah-blah-blah."
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, but it's much more complicated.
    
    
      Yeah, but that's - that's
    
    
      effort.
    
    
      That's the whole problem, that nobody wants to do it.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, O_K.
    
    
      You know how it - you know the process here within the N_S_A group.
    
    
      You know 
    
    
      
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      And - and that was a  reason  I - we finally  decided 
    
    
      here
    
    
      that we put it - information on the N_S_ A  page, we have discuss- dis- this discussed still a couple of months  ago   -  ago. 
    
    
      I think
    
    
      the best solution is really to put a link on the
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I_C_S_I page
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      to this
    
    
      stuff.
    
    
      And the stuff itself is, uh,
    
    
      
    
    
      located at our server.
    
    
      In  our  directory.
    
    
      Yeah,
    
    
      in our directory,
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, we can do that.  We then  create a link and then we have to ask with Jane, O_K?
    
    
      Yes, also fine.
    
    
      Yeah.  Another  point is I want - I want to - would like to add
    
    
      a- another button, something which is called like "events" or,
    
    
      I don't know,
    
    
      yeah, I guess I call it "events" like
    
    
      Hmm?
    
    
      
    
    
      where we could s-
    
    
      uh,
    
    
      announce talks which are,
    
    
      you know,
    
    
      future - talks for the future, or - and where we could also have a link on -
    
    
      
    
    
      for instance the two workshops which  have  going on,
    
    
      uh,
    
    
      last summer,
    
    
      so,
    
    
      Hannes' workshop and then the workshop from Oliver,
    
    
      
    
    
      that there might be a link behind these workshops and - or former talks we have,
    
    
      so like from people who have been here before
    
    
      
    
    
      and he wants to, uh, publish their slides, or an article, or whatsoever, behind there.
    
    
      So, that we have like a button for events which are - where
    
    
      
    
    
      workshops can be announced or old workshops could - could be, um,
    
    
      shown or
    
    
      whatever.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Of course that is a living thing. I think it's a good  idea, 
    
    
      not only that the workshop was a talk announce because they are  still  announce it is a broader sense.
    
    
      
    
    
      Eh, but I think the idea from Claudia is very good,
    
    
      that
    
    
      the slides
    
    
      from the talks here, if it's  worth  to have it on the web, anyway
    
    
      um, should be published in that way that the people can  access   it.
    
    
       For instance  I have my U_S_A_I_A slides.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      maybe
    
    
      if
    
    
      Yeah, that's O_K, too.
    
    
      some
    
    
      things and - is going on maybe you have some  Multicast  slides concerning your work at I_G_M_P and
    
    
      uh
    
    
      and if we have some talks from  EXTERM ,
    
    
      and we had some in the past,
    
    
      we can also put the slides on - on
    
    
      these things - because then they're still cau-
    
    
      still a growing  context  for us,  opportunity  for the people you know there,
    
    
      "Oh, this guy  did  something there,
    
    
      maybe I can contact him and ask him
    
    
      Hmm-hmm-hmm.
    
    
      would you like to do something, contribute, whatever."
    
    
      Uh, so
    
    
      that's - and I think it's a great  idea  from Claudia to -
    
    
      to have this  event  page because
    
    
      
    
    
      it's not
    
    
      a big  deal, 
    
    
      you know. 
    
    
        No  , it's easy to - to add it,
    
    
      It's - it's -
    
    
      I mean.
    
    
      Yeah, and then it's -
    
    
      Nah, O_K. If there are no events, then there  are  no events. But we still have a few which happened in the last year
    
    
      Yeah, yeah.
    
    
      and O_K, then it is a growing thing but it's done automatically that the group leader
    
    
      
    
    
      or the group, uh, put some things eh, also on the web.
    
    
      Something in the center  pipe .
    
    
      Yeah?
    
    
      Everybody agree?
    
    
      
    
    
      Um, I don't know.  Maybe it could be a good thing
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      if we  have  such an event button
    
    
      
    
    
      that, um,
    
    
      somewhere beneath this button or
    
    
      wherever,
    
    
      
    
    
      that there's a  date, 
    
    
      when the last  update  was.
    
    
      So that you know
    
    
      it's worth to
    
    
      click this button
    
    
      to see there's a new, um,
    
    
      
    
    
      announcement or not.
    
    
      S- So otherwise, you are
    
    
      Yeah, O_K.
    
    
      often clicking this button and you
    
    
      get your old information or even an - uh empty page.
    
    
      
    
    
      Maybe there's -
    
    
      Yeah but this will be then
    
    
      down on the button of the page anyways.
    
    
      Yeah, maybe we can have "updated on",
    
    
      So
    
    
      you know the button itself?
    
    
      Yeah, something like that.
    
    
      And then, "updated"
    
    
      "Last updated",
    
    
      and the current date,
    
    
      when - when something happened.
    
    
      yeah.
    
    
      I don't know how we deal with that.
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      
    
    
      Is it another  thing we have to ?
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      So it's just a su- suggestion I don't know how
    
    
      easy it is to - to implement something like that.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Huh!  O_K.
    
    
      O_K  you  Well.
    
    
      
    
    
      Let's consider
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      "update event button". 
    
    
      
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      So, and then the next point
    
    
      and, I believe, yeah,
    
    
      
    
    
      So, 
    
    
      
    
    
      not the last one,
    
    
      
    
    
      is one that I would like to know the status as far it is possible from everybody
    
    
      concerning his
    
    
      future intention here
    
    
      at I_C_S_I or whether e- when he will leave whether he can
    
    
      contri- or will he  consider  currently,
    
    
      
    
    
      uh, contribute here to the proposal
    
    
      
    
    
      because you know, I've - I'm facing the problem,
    
    
      if I go back to Siemens and I say "O_K, there's a potential."
    
    
      "There are potential contacts."
    
    
      currently, maybe no money,
    
    
      
    
    
      but if we go in one direction
    
    
      
    
    
      it -
    
    
      - it is  worth  to know
    
    
      if people
    
    
      can still go on in that area of that kind of work then they are back in their university or their company or whatever.
    
    
      
    
    
      and even if it's   nur unschl-  
    
    
      part-time
    
    
      jobs and -
    
    
      and if it's come to a real  proposal,  that maybe the people can hook  in, 
    
    
      
    
    
      uh, one more  time  because I need this information definitely t-
    
    
      uh, to inform
    
    
      the
    
    
      uh,
    
    
      the Siemens management
    
    
      that it's  worth  to send me back  here. 
    
    
      So maybe Wilbert you can start. You will leave end of January definitely.
    
    
      And currently you see no  chance,  as far as I know,
    
    
      uh, to stay longer here
    
    
      and either you will go back to K_P_N
    
    
      or you will stay here and find then a job opportunity another company, is that right?
    
    
      Yes,
    
    
      yeah.
    
    
      Can you give us more
    
    
      details of - concerning the status?
    
    
      No,
    
    
      No?
    
    
      no.
    
    
      Pending.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Pending.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      See for me it's the same I can also say, uh,
    
    
      for me  everything   has completely changed, so now I go back and I don't anything what to do,
    
    
      so it's like I have to sort everything out when I'm
    
    
      Yes, but you have no -
    
    
      back in Germany 
    
    
      but I won't go back to the university so
    
    
      yeah?
    
    
      I don't think so.
    
    
      So you are looking for a job. That's probably then - O_K.
    
    
      in principle, I would like to say you are lost for the N_S_A group, because
    
    
      Then it's like
    
    
      yeah.
    
    
      ffft 
    
    
      that's uh,
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah,
    
    
      it would be a -
    
    
      No, no, no. 
    
    
      a wonder if, uh,
    
    
      it hook in at the same area, you know.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Uh, but that's also for me, I'm kind of lost for the N_S_A group.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I think so, yeah.
    
    
      "Lost" is maybe a bit like -
    
    
      And oh, also -
    
    
      
    
    
       Ja  
    
    
      
    
    
      also
    
    
       
    
    
      from the work contributions, you know.
    
    
      Well,
    
    
      
    
    
      b- but I think even - also K_P_ N. 
    
    
      i-
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      is lost for the, uh, for the I_C_S_ I. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Uh, do you know whether they have -
    
    
      There's a
    
    
      lot of, uh, z-
    
    
      budget cuts going on and
    
    
       nothing  is possible anymore, so.
    
    
      Um, so from your side
    
    
      the statement is,
    
    
      um, that, uh,
    
    
      independently of your person
    
    
      uh, the K_P_N is
    
    
      not - they're not willing to send us another guy here to I_C_S_I anyway.
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
       Absolutely. 
    
    
      And,  if  they are interested in
    
    
      uh, a certain kind of  project 
    
    
      then it must be related
    
    
      to a certain kind of really  service  or a certain kind of  end  system or real  product  or whatever kind of  thing 
    
    
      
    
    
      with respect to U_M_T_S, right?
    
    
      I- it -
    
    
      It will be  different  thing.
    
    
      It will be a -
    
    
      it will be a start-up.
    
    
      And I know they're - they're working on a w-
    
    
      a  few  of them in this  area, 
    
    
      but it's  ou- outside of I_C_S_I.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      So,
    
    
      K_P_N and - and I_C_S_I
    
    
      in principle.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      After you will leave here  that is .
    
    
      Yeah, and then  what do you intend to do in the last two months
    
    
      beside of course, looking for,
    
    
      u-
    
    
      Holidays
    
    
      Th-
    
    
      yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Um, I am working
    
    
      now on - on something,
    
    
      uh an open source  router.  
    
    
      This is  that from  from Mark, right?
    
    
      No, in -
    
    
      Not?
    
    
      well, it's a little bit u-
    
    
      out of Mark. I'm -
    
    
      
    
    
      Right now I'm interested and I'm looking into it and I'm  working  - started yesterday, actually  working  on it,
    
    
      
    
    
      to do the, uh -
    
    
      u-
    
    
      to do an implementation of the protocol that was designed by Mark,
    
    
      
    
    
      um, on an open-source router that's different from
    
    
      the one that - of Mark's project.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah, do you finish that and
    
    
      S- s-
    
    
      do you believe that you can  finish  that until
    
    
      I  hope  so. I-
    
    
      end of January?
    
    
      That would be  cool. 
    
    
      It sounded - sounded to me a little bit -
    
    
      Yeah. It's
    
    
      little bit,  hard t- hard - hard  time  constraint, right?
    
    
       hard  work.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      That's right.
    
    
      But I'm  working  on it.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      O_K, Mi-  Miguel,  
    
    
      maybe you can say also.
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh, I'll be -
    
    
      I'll be here until the end of July.
    
    
      And, uh, well, eh
    
    
      even later
    
    
      
    
    
      if, uh, there is  some  interesting work, uh, going on, well I - I will
    
    
      
    
    
      be able to
    
    
      
    
    
      to  do  some work from Spain too.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      So, that's my  future
    
    
      
    
    
      uh forecast.
    
    
      Mm-hmm,
    
    
      and, uh, do you have some  students  which could be join
    
    
       Yeah.   
    
    
      if there is -
    
    
      I assume there  is  a certain activity. Maybe i- if you will leave in July
    
    
      Yeah, well, you know,
    
    
      uh the problem the - I think that we have a - a problem - or a difference in Spain, at least,
    
    
      
    
    
      compared with the Americans.
    
    
      
    
    
      And i- is that our students are, uh -
    
    
      
    
    
      are not getting involved
    
    
      
    
    
      in research
    
    
      until they have,
    
    
      uh,  finished  their studies.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      So, uh, it's something a little bit, uh, strange but it is this -
    
    
      this is the w-
    
    
      What? They are not -
    
    
      sorry?
    
    
      They are not involved in - in research?
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      You know -
    
    
      What they are  doing  then?
    
    
       I'm sorry .
    
    
      Lectures.
    
    
      Huh?
    
    
      You know, they -
    
    
       Ach so,     ach so,  
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      You - you have to - to pass the different  tests  and you have to study the different  subjects.  And,
    
    
      
    
    
      until you have
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
       finished  with this, uh well -
    
    
      O_K,
    
    
      you can do it
    
    
      by - by your own, but -
    
    
      
    
    
      but the thing is that
    
    
      
    
    
      you're  not  supposed to do it.
    
    
      And usually students are pretty busy
    
    
      
    
    
      for not doing  other  things.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      Uh.
    
    
      And there's no final master's thesis or something like that
    
    
      Ah yeah em nnn,  not really.
    
    
      what they have to perform?
    
    
      You know,
    
    
      there  is. 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      There is. But,
    
    
      
    
    
      uh,
    
    
      it is  not  a research work.
    
    
      Usually it's an  application  work.
    
    
       So you build a web site, your own E_commerce site, uh,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      whatever, or a program or -
    
    
      
    
    
      Why I didn't study in Spain?
    
    
      but -
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      But it is not, uh, something your
    
    
      teacher provides you some research papers and you,
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      let's say, build a simulator or try to.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Are certain  tasks  and so?
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      So
    
    
      we have, uh, other students  are 
    
    
      which are, uh,
    
    
      mmm
    
    
      people that has a grant
    
    
      
    
    
      and they are -
    
    
      
    
    
      they are starting as, uh,  researchers, 
    
    
      
    
    
      aaa,  but
    
    
      this is
    
    
      only connected
    
    
      
    
    
      to your own funding so if you - if you have projects
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      you can have,
    
    
      uh, people  working  with you. If you don't have,
    
    
      
    
    
      a research project
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      well, you cannot pay them so u- u- usually
    
    
      
    
    
      you don't have  anybody. 
    
    
      So it's kind of, uh,
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      dependent
    
    
      on
    
    
      the funding we have
    
    
      in some projects.
    
    
      So
    
    
      w-
    
    
      it's
    
    
      Hmm?
    
    
      not sure,
    
    
      No,
    
    
      not really sure.
    
    
      there.
    
    
      
    
    
      We're not  talking  about to send the students here to I_C_S_ I. 
    
    
      I'm talking if there  is  an activity, at  least  with the N_S_A group,
    
    
      that certain kind of activities also in the university
    
    
      could apply for the master works, of
    
    
      diplomas thesis,  uh,  whatever  kind of thing
    
    
      Yeah,
    
    
      we - we -
    
    
      I think we could -
    
    
      that -
    
    
      We could find, uh,
    
    
      some, eh work force.
    
    
      O_K?
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Because - well, you - you can, eh,
    
    
      fo-  redirect
    
    
      you know, the - the work as - uh
    
    
      let's say as a subject  work  of something
    
    
      
    
    
      that you can - 
    
    
      you can try to, eh, s-
    
    
      In some subjects, in fact,
    
    
      
    
    
      eh, the - the - the, uh, topics are more open so
    
    
      
    
    
      you can introduce some research topics too. So 
    
    
      but
    
    
      the main thing is that
    
    
      there is a, uh, this
    
    
      big difference
    
    
      
    
    
      because, eh, students are  not  supposed to do
    
    
      research, eh, work until they have
    
    
      finished their gra- their grade.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      You can  change  that. 
    
    
      Yeah, sure.
    
    
      M- uh, maybe you sh-
    
    
      Sure.
    
    
      I think it's pretty  healthy  for a student to -  to have a project, eh, where you have to write actually some part of research or.
    
    
      Yeah, I think  so  too,  but,
    
    
      eh, you know, it also depends
    
    
      on the  subjects  because sometimes
    
    
      Sure.
    
    
      subjects are  fixed 
    
    
      so you cannot - you cannot, uh
    
    
       O_K .
    
    
      uh,  give  any - any stuff you want.
    
    
      You have to -
    
    
      
    
    
      to provide a certain - a certain  prime  
    
    
      
    
    
      O-
    
    
      for the subject too, 
    
    
      Of course.
    
    
      but,
    
    
      you know,
    
    
      sometimes, especially in the -
    
    
      
    
    
      in the latest, eh uh, courses
    
    
      uh, things are probably more open and, well, it - it
    
    
      is  something  that can be changed.
    
    
      Mm-hmm. O_K. Thank you.
    
    
      Claudia, I still mentioned,
    
    
      Have you other things? 
    
    
      For me, as I said before
    
    
      I will be funded by a d-
    
    
      uh by the ministry of,
    
    
      uh, the German government for research in the project so-called  Invinet 
    
    
      That seems to be sure.
    
    
      And I got
    
    
      absolutely  freedom 
    
    
      to do
    
    
      what I would like to do,
    
    
      and I would like to go on with the Q_S in advance  mechanism  
    
    
      and, uh,
    
    
      in the
    
    
      relation of U_S_A_I_A I  also  have the
    
    
      
    
    
      activities with Georgia Tech.
    
    
      They have now a P_H_D.  It is   settled, 
    
    
      and my other next, uh, generation of contract
    
    
      is also going in that sense so the topic is still going - go- going  on. 
    
    
      
    
    
      and when I will come back  here,  I would like to use these things too to maybe come to a
    
    
      
    
    
      closer, a bigger project
    
    
      um, outside of this goal, with contributions here from, uh 
    
    
      first of all from the N_S_A group and then from - from  other  partners.
    
    
      But  this  I have definitely  ou- uh  discussed with my management
    
    
      and  this will happened,
    
    
      I believe, in December,
    
    
      maybe, and in the beginning of January.
    
    
      and I will keep informed to the management of I_C_S_I anyway,
    
    
      
    
    
      but also,
    
    
      I assume that my suggestions that we have a weekly phone conference
    
    
      and email exchange  during that time
    
    
      so that we can
    
    
      inform each other
    
    
      
    
    
      concerning what are the questions, what are the problems, what is the status and so on.
    
    
      Uh? But
    
    
      I think we will
    
    
      uh
    
    
       detail  these things
    
    
      then in one of the last meetings.
    
    
      So
    
    
      how is your status and - and your ideas and your plans and your future and -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Well
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      I will -
    
    
      You're addicted to the testbeds you run on the hour, so that's -
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      No, no, no, no, no. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      So I will stay here
    
    
      till the end of February
    
    
      
    
    
      and
    
    
      afterwards, um, at Berlin I'm
    
    
      yeah,  funded   by an institution of the German government, so,
    
    
      
    
    
      they are paying me,
    
    
      
    
    
      and I have to do research for  them,  of course. I have to
    
    
      
    
    
      um
    
    
      well, uh,
    
    
      reach some goals and so on.
    
    
      
    
    
      But on the other hand there will be some
    
    
      time left I think to do some work on 
    
    
      this area I started here.
    
    
      
    
    
      And for me, myself, I'm
    
    
      also very interested in - in continue this work
    
    
      
    
    
      and so that will
    
    
      be manageable
    
    
      and, um,
    
    
      on the other hand there are also
    
    
      
    
    
      uh, some students or -
    
    
      well,
    
    
      at the moment it's  quite difficult to find students, eh, who are doing their master's thesis and so on
    
    
      
    
    
      because there  are  not a lot of students, uh, which are in this state in Germany now,
    
    
      
    
    
      but um,
    
    
      about
    
    
      two years ago the
    
    
      numbers of students
    
    
      were, um, studying computer science,
    
    
      
    
    
      uh,
    
    
      started to increase again and
    
    
      so in
    
    
      one or two years we will have,
    
    
      
    
    
      uh, many students, uh, which are performing their master's thesis and so
    
    
      
    
    
      I think there will also be, uh,
    
    
      many students
    
    
      
    
    
      which are joining in this work.
    
    
      So, hopefully,
    
    
      
    
    
      uh, I will found - will find some students which are
    
    
      joining in and, um 
    
    
      So,
    
    
      hopefully this work will be go on.
    
    
      Mm-hmm. O_K, sounded good to me.
    
    
      And Michael?
    
    
      So,  I won't change the  topic  then.
    
    
      I'm here until
    
    
      end of May
    
    
      
    
    
      and after that I presumably going to a  Siemens  project with some - department of  gee-mens , but related to that
    
    
      topic
    
    
      what I have done here. So,
    
    
      
    
    
      it's some of pre-stage  to that, so it might be more
    
    
      
    
    
      related or loosely related. So it's
    
    
      at least it's in the same topic.
    
    
      
    
    
      And   progress,  it's  going  on, 
    
    
      
    
    
      but it's not that fast going on as I would have like it.
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Oh,
    
    
      I would like to have it.  Sorry.
    
    
      Well
    
    
       but oder? 
    
    
      Yeah, then, what is the current status anyway?
    
    
       @@  this is.
    
    
      Um, I'm - currently I'm looking into
    
    
      
    
    
      Quality of Service Routing, and I had discussions with a post-doc from the U_- U_C_B.
    
    
      
    
    
      Well,
    
    
      
    
    
      we want to -
    
    
      we started to
    
    
      collect information to
    
    
      
    
    
      write the paper about Quality of Serving  routing.
    
    
      
    
    
      for M_P_L_S in an M_P_L_S domain.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      So you have  um distributed routing at the edges,
    
    
      
    
    
      and
    
    
      one aspect
    
    
      is
    
    
      
    
    
      that the information is  outdated,  so that you  know to  always have the
    
    
       exact  information of your links, dates, and so on.
    
    
      It what we  have  plans of that.
    
    
      
    
    
      And trying to
    
    
      
    
    
      look at some  routing   policies,
    
    
      or routing algorithms.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Now as I  see,  in principle, uh
    
    
      fff 
    
    
      that's a really  raw view .
    
    
      M_P_L_S offers certain kind of  success  of active routing, because
    
    
      in principle, the
    
    
       forwarding  pass is a little bit
    
    
       decoupled  from this - from the  routing  pass,  and this was, in principle -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      O_K, it's - it's not
    
    
      It - it -
    
    
       really  the subject but in a broader sense it could be seen
    
    
      It d- yeah.
    
    
      in that sense. I think
    
    
      uh, there are
    
    
      in a certain degree
    
    
      some alignment with - with both of you guys, right?
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      So at least from the desh-
    
    
      definition of Christian  Tschudin,  M_P_L_S is a
    
    
      subset of -
    
    
      
    
    
      of
    
    
      active  route-
    
    
      active routing.
    
    
      
    
    
      So it's very -  It's static? It's - No, active?
    
    
      But it's  sort  of active  because they have these program
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      statements.
    
    
      Yeah, maybe it's a separation, in principle, that I do not use the normal traditional,
    
    
      But y-
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      uh, data  forwarding  pass
    
    
      
    
    
      and  update,  in principle, only the routing information
    
    
      
    
    
      uh, to - to - to use it.
    
    
      Well, they are - they are using
    
    
      the - the - the same idea of labeling  packets
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      with a -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      with a
    
    
      content descriptor or something.
    
    
      That's right.
    
    
      Yeah, so what I mean is at a  certain   degree, 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      yeah, that has to be figured  out. 
    
    
      There's a connection point. 
    
    
      There is, uh, there are some linkage between them.
    
    
       @@ 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      in both of your -
    
    
      your work.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      So,
    
    
      my last point, uh, in principle, is the proposal itself.
    
    
      Um
    
    
      I know, in the past it was always if  I'm 
    
    
      not  writing  something nothing gonna  happen. 
    
    
      
    
    
      So, I believe, Wilbert, you are going  out  of these activity.
    
    
      
    
    
      You have to use your  time 
    
    
      to
    
    
      finish your work as you
    
    
      uh,
    
    
      have in mind until your
    
    
      end of February, or is that right?
    
    
      January, yes.
    
    
      End of January, sorry, so you will not - y-
    
    
      you will not find  any  time to contribute anymore to this
    
    
      activity.
    
    
      No.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Then from  Miguel's  side
    
    
      I expect more
    
    
      detailed vision.
    
    
      We can do it, as I mentioned before,  bilateral   afterwards,
    
    
      Later. 
    
    
      
    
    
      uh, concerning your work and how you think it could be
    
    
       beneficial   contribution to the activity
    
    
      maybe based on the generic
    
    
      uh, uh, U_S_A_I_A architecture.
    
    
       I  will write
    
    
      as
    
    
      long as I have  time  here,
    
    
      uh, on the proposal  itself  and in the near-term future,
    
    
      I will
    
    
      distribute a list
    
    
      of the
    
    
      small cluster
    
    
      of people.
    
    
      
    
    
      I tried to access
    
    
      Juan Peire
    
    
       several  times,
    
    
      he didn't answer, because he still had mentioned that there's some minor funding,
    
    
      that I think would help,
    
    
      for instance, to have initial meeting
    
    
      either here or in Europe or - or wherever.
    
    
      
    
    
      I've, uh, contact
    
    
      one more time the professor, what is his name? Rao? or - ? 
    
    
      uh, L- Landay mentioned, uh,
    
    
      L- Lan-
    
    
      Rao, right?
    
    
       Landay?  
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      because he's a professor in - uh, responsible for the  infrastructure  at U_C_B and he has some projects
    
    
       Landay. 
    
    
      Ah.
    
    
      which are related to
    
    
      
    
    
      um, these - these, uh, activities
    
    
      I would c- c- name it  cor-  intelligent classroom.
    
    
      
    
    
      I don't know whether I can succeed to get an  appointment  then
    
    
      but I will distribute a list -
    
    
      contact list and  @@  the interests of each partner
    
    
      so that everybody can see
    
    
      
    
    
      and
    
    
      everybody knows, yeah, I have in mind
    
    
      maybe it's a small N_S_A group activity
    
    
      itself,
    
    
      with no linkage to the outer world
    
    
      
    
    
      maybe it's a N_S_A group activity with a linkage to the outer world
    
    
      based on the
    
    
      uh universities at home or the companies at home
    
    
      
    
    
      there's some linkage
    
    
      
    
    
      and the third stage is, let's say there's a N_S_A group activity in this area,
    
    
      
    
    
      uh, with the supported, um,
    
    
      home entities
    
    
      and with certain kind of linkage here to the companies or u- or universities here in this area.
    
    
      The last one, I think it's, uh, the best one.
    
    
      
    
    
      But, you see the question is always "Where's the money?"
    
    
      and I say "Oh poo,  currently I don't know."
    
    
      
    
    
      The second question is how long I stay here and say ooo,   I don't know",
    
    
      
    
    
      so
    
    
      everybody's waiting.
    
    
      Yeah, and the only rea-
    
    
      um,
    
    
      activity could come from the N_S_A group itself,
    
    
      but I think it's a - a work in process and that it will take some time and, uh,
    
    
      
    
    
      everything must be  just  settled a little bit more.
    
    
      So, but anyway, I would like to get contributions
    
    
      from the people here of the N_S_A group concerning proposals, this is a living thing
    
    
      
    
    
      and
    
    
      it's a  pity 
    
    
      that Multicast is, in principle,  removed 
    
    
      
    
    
      and we do not have any  expert  from Multicast anymore.
    
    
      And, uh, that's makes very hard, I believe.
    
    
      Because that is a major ,
    
    
      at least twenty-five percent of the whole network
    
    
      uh, stuff
    
    
      and, um, but neverless we have to  live  with this situation.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      You are laughing, again?   
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      So maybe we have to  rewrite something, have new ideas going forward more in
    
    
      certain kind of really telecommunication network and the routing and Q_S stuff,
    
    
      and remove, in principle, the Multicast stuff
    
    
      which, in principle, a pity because I think that's a really really good eh -
    
    
      uh 
    
    
      mmm
    
    
      source of research work
    
    
      for the future telecommunication  core  networks because
    
    
      they are still not able to deal with Multicast, they still have there that
    
    
      tunnel generations and all those kind of things 
    
    
      and I - I believe that would be very  beneficial   to use it for the
    
    
      really  uh, mobile scenarios in - in that network,
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      so - but anyway we have to live with a real situation and that means we have to
    
    
      drop Multicast from the proposal.
    
    
      
    
    
      Any comments?
    
    
      Oh, not  really,  you know,
    
    
      uh, I - I - I - I think that -
    
    
      Well, in the future,
    
    
      somebody will come
    
    
      to the N_S_A group
    
    
      
    
    
      eh
    
    
      Then we can  extend  the proposal one more time with  Multicast. 
    
    
      Ah,
    
    
      so -
    
    
      
    
    
       No,  I mean 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      that -
    
    
       O_K ,
    
    
      I - I - I think that
    
    
      it cannot, eh, be, eh considered the first type task to do because
    
    
      nobody is - is  knowledgeable  about multicasting but
    
    
      I think that, eh, any of us
    
    
      could
    
    
       address  these things in the  future, 
    
    
      
    
    
      or maybe
    
    
      a new  person  could address this.
    
    
      in the future. So
    
    
      
    
    
      if -
    
    
      I mean,
    
    
      wh- what I think is that,
    
    
      uh, it - it  makes  no sense to me
    
    
      
    
    
      to reduce,
    
    
      
    
    
      uh, uh, uh, uh,
    
    
      something which is more or less
    
    
      complete,
    
    
      because we don't have the person. I think that the - the way to -
    
    
      to go is probably the opposite, to try to find
    
    
      
    
    
      something which has
    
    
      
    
    
      a  meaning  by  itself 
    
    
      
    
    
      and then try to get
    
    
      the resources to - to -
    
    
      
    
    
      to do
    
    
      this -
    
    
      Oh, maybe you understand me in the wrong way.
    
    
      Uh,
    
    
      I do not mean to drop it, to remove the text from the proposal.
    
    
       O_K ,
    
    
      I mean, activities, planning activities.
    
    
       O_K .
    
    
       Sorry. 
    
    
      Yeah,
    
    
      Work packages.
    
    
      that's O_K.
    
    
      Sorry, sorry, heh?
    
    
      Yeah,
    
    
      so
    
    
      Now I
    
    
      no, no, because that's, uh, that's why I mentioned that it is important  thing. 
    
    
      But, currently there's only one
    
    
      new group member,
    
    
      Sven Buchholz,
    
    
      who will figure out the thing,
    
    
      hmm
    
    
      how to say,
    
    
      um, the
    
    
      taking  into  account the  end  system,
    
    
      or the limited end system capabilities
    
    
      with respect to mobility and the network itself.
    
    
      Where it should be ada-  - where should be, uh, the  adaptation   process  performed 
    
    
      
    
    
      to deal with the different devices,
    
    
      for  ubiquitous   access to the network? Should it be in the end system itself?
    
    
      Should be in the edge device? It should it be in the core? should it be on the server?
    
    
      These are the questions he would like to figure out.
    
    
      And to p- uh, to have, in principle, the pro and cons
    
    
      
    
    
      of, uh, different - of all these different approaches.
    
    
      So that's the only
    
    
      new  member. 
    
    
      Who is that?
    
    
      Sven Buchholz.
    
    
      He was here. I invited him and discussed with him
    
    
      his potential
    
    
      work, I  @@ . 
    
    
       quite sure 
    
    
      Oh, he was here one day.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      But he showed up the  next day but only for administration stuff, but for the technical discussion he was here one day.
    
    
       Several  days.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I- I'm do not remember whether - w- whether you were -
    
    
      That must be three weeks ago,
    
    
      cuz I r-
    
    
      Yeah, I do  remember  him, but I didn't talk with him about, uh -  about the  research 
    
    
      I  just met him when I arrived.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      topic.
    
    
      So I didn't know what he was going to do.
    
    
      Yeah, he will come
    
    
      mid of January, I believe, yeah,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      as far as I know.
    
    
      So, but this is the only guy, you know,
    
    
      but that is not reflected in that sense that we remove the text.
    
    
      
    
    
      what I mean is - is, uh, the -
    
    
       O_K .
    
    
      that we -
    
    
      what's kind of activity we are going more in detail in describing, the network packages and -
    
    
      and detailed, uh, uh, descriptions -
    
    
      more detailed descriptions.
    
    
      So
    
    
      
    
    
      Any  other  question?
    
    
      Any  other  comment?
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      Then we pu- should start with reading the numbers
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      one more time.
    
    
      Oh, again?
    
    
      We have to  do  that?  Oh! 
    
    
      Yes, we  have to do it, so that means we have to read the transcript script
    
    
       I don't know .
    
    
      number and then the numbers,
    
    
      and if there's a
