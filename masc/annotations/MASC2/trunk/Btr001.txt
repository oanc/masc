       O_K.  
    
    
      
    
    
      And, do you have my number?
    
    
      Um, w- would you mind telling me again, please?
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh, he's gonna write it. O_K.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Now, if the batteries were to go out during the meeting, there's really - what do we do?
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Put a new one in.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Do we have batteries back there? O_K.
    
    
      O_K. And you'll be in your office during this? Oh, thank you very much.
    
    
      Actually, I'll probably get some coffee then I'll be back.
    
    
      Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Could you close the door for me please?
    
    
      What's - so what do we do with this? Anything?
    
    
      Just put your name on it, I think.
    
    
       
    
    
      Oh, O_K.
    
    
      
    
    
       O_K,   thanks.
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
       So,  thanks very much for coming.
    
    
      
    
    
      O_K. So um -
    
    
      let's see, so,
    
    
      um, as you know, the meeting today is to, um,
    
    
        benefit from  your  involvement in the data, all the things that - that  you've  been exposed to in these many months.
    
    
      
    
    
      And um, I just - I just put down some ideas - you've seen some of this in the email that I sent out earlier.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      And, um,
    
    
      
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      none of these - these are not obligatory toca- topics but they're just things that I thought might be useful to discuss, just as a way of organizing the discussion.
    
    
      But if there are other topics you'd like to discuss that'd be great too.
    
    
      Alright, so um,
    
    
      it struck me that, um,
    
    
      you know, we could start out with some sort of general thing about,
    
    
      um,  things that you found easier or more difficult with respect to transcribing or checking or using the interface or,
    
    
      
    
    
      uh, dealing with the time bins or any aspect of that type.
    
    
      And then, maybe talk about  specifics   - specifics of the data
    
    
      and then maybe talk about, um, aspects of the conventions
    
    
      and then the technical
    
    
      set-up regarding the, um, auditory image and the interface.
    
    
      
    
    
      O_K, so,
    
    
      maybe we could just, um, start with
    
    
      issues of the -   the tar- ti- up there at the top of -
    
    
      
    
    
      What - what did you find easiest or more s- most difficult about transcribing the data?
    
    
       O_K.
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      
    
    
      One thing that I remember being really difficult at the beginning and it got easier as we went along was, um, acronyms and technical terms.
    
    
      
    
    
      Um, because there are so many and -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      it's a field that
    
    
      I'm not really l- very -
    
    
      I don't know, I don't know very much about this kind of stuff - computers and
    
    
      speech recognition. I've never taken
    
    
      classes on it or anything, so. I found that really hard.
    
    
      And
    
    
      I remember transcribing and having a bunch of - You know, every five words there'd be something I'd put in parentheses cuz I didn't know what it was.
    
    
      So.
    
    
      Parentheses, meaning uncertainty.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      Yeah, but it's definitely gotten easier because
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      the same things keep getting  repeated,  once you learn what it  is,  and you can say, "O_K
    
    
      I know what they meant by that" or "I know how to  spell  that now" or something like that.
    
    
       Is -
    
    
      And the Cast of Characters that you put up on the Web was helpful
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      also.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      O_K, good.
    
    
      It's sorta like a foreign language, isn't it? It's basically - you have these
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       specialized terms for things that  I  didn't know n- needed specialized terms.  Yeah.
    
    
        @@  
    
    
      Especially when describing like the set-up in this room, also, and the different types of mikes.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      I don't know.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      And it's hard to tell when people are talking relatively quickly. They just
    
    
      glide over some of the letters. They don't fully pronounce them. So you can't really tell even if you listen to it ten times
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
       
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah. I usually put most of the acronyms in parentheses cuz I think it's
    
    
      what it is.
    
    
      sort of safe, cuz people can -
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      people can say their acronyms really fast and
    
    
      I figure that even if I  think  I know exactly what letters they said,
    
    
      it's probably best to put them in parentheses cuz I probably  don't. 
    
    
      That's not a bad strategy. I mean, i- it's - it's true that I - I always check the parentheses at the last stage and those are pretty easy to clear, in terms of when they're in context.
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Not a bad strategy.
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Some of them just occurred over and over the - again, so like - P_D_A.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      Like that
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      got - got easy. There - there was a - a bunch of  them   that, uh -
    
    
      I suspect in context.
    
    
      They just kept getting repeated often and often- you know, over and over, so. Just got better, but.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      And also when you have the - the juxtaposition of P_D_A and P_Z_M -
    
    
      
    
    
      then, you know, you -   in context you can tell which one it's -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      is probably likely to be the one that you  had. 
    
    
      Even though I still don't know what they  are.  
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      I mean, I assume they're microphones of some sort, but that's all. 
    
    
      Well these here are the P_Z_Ms, that right there.
    
    
      Oh. 
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      Is anybody wearing one of those awful quote  Crown  microphones that people used to be - Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      No.
    
    
      
    
    
      Uh you've heard, the "crown of pain".  
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      No. He was telling us, uh, before the meeting that, um,
    
    
      that they're not in circulation right now, that they're - they were unpopular.
    
    
      I liked  them,   and Adam liked  them.   I thought the quality was good.
    
    
      Huh.
    
    
      Oh. Oh, O_K.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Just curious. 
    
    
      What -
    
    
      yeah, what did he say? He said some more things about that, but I was n- I was working on something else. Uh-huh.
    
    
      About the microphone?
    
    
      I can't remember. I mean he's e-
    
    
       he - he said that they were designed for
    
    
      a specific sized head?
    
    
      Ah, yeah. Yeah, that's right.
    
    
      
    
    
      Right?
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      And so if - if your head happened to be that size, then you were fine and if it w- was bigger, then it was like
    
    
      That's right.
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      torture, 
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, it's -
    
    
      o- or - I don't know.
    
    
      I don't know.
    
    
      I liked  them.   And there's the - actually, there's the picture of the - of the Crown adjustment on the
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      wall right there.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      So it sort of hooks over your ears from the back.
    
    
       Right.
    
    
      Oh, yeah.
    
    
      Oh, O_K.
    
    
      Yeah, good c-
    
    
      Oh, it doesn't look so bad, but, I guess it depends really.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      O_K, so now what about accents?
    
    
      Do you have, uh - Did you find any p-
    
    
      
    
    
      They're tough sometimes.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Sometimes the German accents can get a little bit daunting. I mean,
    
    
      um,
    
    
      I forget who it was that I was transcribing but, it was tough to figure out what e- e- he was saying,
    
    
      uh, at  any  given point in time and I would
    
    
      I would just listen to it over and over and over again, going "Oh my God! My head's gonna  explode! "  like,
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      not really understanding a-
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      you know?
    
    
      And so
    
    
      I was getting a little frustrated because
    
    
      I would put a  lot  of things into parentheses and then go back over it and go back over it again and still -
    
    
      you know, I - I  like  to try to clear as much up as I  possibly   can  and
    
    
      I - I just felt like
    
    
      you know, with the  German  accents, just for me personally, those were probably the toughest
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      to get around.
    
    
      Um, they weren't impossible but just - like they too- the m- they took the most time too.
    
    
      I mean I would take maybe twice as long on a - a g- given channel w- with a speaker who has a German accent than somebody who's
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Hm-hmm.
    
    
      you know, a native English speaker, 
    
    
      or even  Asian  - like, uh, speaks an En- Asian language. I found that easier.
    
    
      Uh,  you  know.
    
    
      Uh, somebody who speaks like Chinese or something, .
    
    
      What's - you've  studied some languages, which - which ones do you - are you studying? It's more of a Romance direction, or - ?
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      Um, yeah - well, I studied - I mean,  I studied Old English for a while.  Um,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      and then I've worked with Larry Hyman on like some of the Bantu languages.
    
    
      Um, and you know, I'm also working with Ian Maddieson and he's been doing work on
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      the, uh,
    
    
      like also some African languages. So I've  like learned a little bit.
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm, so it's not really - you're not really  exposed  to German very much.
    
    
      No, I mean I  sing  in German. 
    
    
      Ah!  Interesting. Interesting.
    
    
      
    
    
      But -  I mean, I can - I can  pronounce  it but I don't  know  any. 
    
    
      Huh.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      That's interesting.
    
    
       
    
    
      Hmm-hmm.
    
    
      I can do - I can  pronounce  a lot of languages and not actually  speak  them because of singing. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Huh.
    
    
      
    
    
      For  me  I found the  Spanish  speakers to be the hardest.
    
    
      And the German speakers I found a  little  bit easier, and I thought maybe that was because I had -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I  took  German for a semester and I've had exposure to German,
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      
    
    
      um, because I had a lot of friends who were really into Germany and German language and -
    
    
      But -
    
    
      And I found that I could -
    
    
      if they were pronouncing something in a certain way I could say, "Oh well that's just the German way of pronouncing  this " and then I figured out what they were saying.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      um, but with the  Spanish  speakers it was -
    
    
      I've never  taken  Spanish, and even though I've taken  French, 
    
    
      and I speak French fairly  well,  um, I found the Spanish to be much
    
    
      harder and -
    
    
      maybe also because
    
    
      the level of fluency for the Spanish speakers was a little bit less than the level of fluency of the German speakers that are here? I think-
    
    
      Oh. 
    
    
      If you're talking about who I  think  you're talking about - are you talking about um -
    
    
      
    
    
      There was a couple of different Spanish speakers.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Can we give names?  We - w- we probably shouldn't, right?
    
    
      O- can - yeah. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Is that -
    
    
      I- it's a good question. Um,
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      And I can't really answer that. 
    
    
       O_K, well there's one in particular
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      who I find the hardest to transcribe of all, and it's - d- she's Spanish.
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh. 
    
    
      So.
    
    
      Oh yeah, O_K.
    
    
      And, um, and I've
    
    
      taken lots - I'm  fluent  in Spanish, and so, um, when I -
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      when I correct it, I
    
    
      can t-
    
    
      I can  tay   -
    
    
      tell that the person who, um, transcribed it before me probably
    
    
      didn't speak Spanish, cuz I can catch a lot of things like -
    
    
      like "No, that's not what she said", I can tell she's  pronouncing -
    
    
      pronouncing it the way that if you read it from a - you know, a Spanish speaker's
    
    
      mind that you would, you know, pronounce it the way that you would pronounce it in Spanish. But the same time,
    
    
      uh I can't get most of it, cuz I - 
    
    
      Huh, that's really interesting.
    
    
      Oh, that's fascinating.
    
    
      Huh.
    
    
      I find it one  of   - one of the hardest ones to transcribe.
    
    
      Well, what you can  see  is that it's - it's her lack of - of  English  fluency that's being -
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Oh O_K.
    
    
      I think so, yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, that's - that's really interesting. I  do  find that the  German  tends to be  easier  for me than s- than the others because of my c- exposure and interest in German.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      But, um,
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Maybe I haven't transcribed this Spanish woman, I don't know if I have.
    
    
      I suspect you haven't because this was, uh, earlier on that we had a lot of -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      actually she - she was in the middle phase I would say. We had another Spanish speaker who was earlier who was also difficult.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah, he was hard.
    
    
       Yeah.
    
    
      But that's really interesting.
    
    
      He got easier though, because he started - like he would say certain words over and over, and -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      And you got to know his pronunciation of them. I remember, yeah.
    
    
      Yeah. So when he said "sign-yah",
    
    
      Yes. Yes yes yes.
    
    
      and it sounds like "sign", he was saying "signal".
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      Yeah, I remember that. And - and m- eh the way he said "mixed" was really strange, too. "Miss-ed" or somethi- yeah.
    
    
      Ex-
    
    
      And so I would transcribe it as "signal".
    
    
       Oh, wow.
    
    
      Ah!  
    
    
      exactly.
    
    
      Huh.
    
    
      "Miss-ed". 
    
    
      "Meexe", "meese", "mees-uh", or something. Right.
    
    
      "Miss-"
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
       Huh.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Which was - you know, you could predict it, I mean, if you knew -
    
    
      He -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      That's kinda cool.
    
    
      look- looked back at it, they -
    
    
      Especially because also in the beginning meetings, I mean, he'd say something and no one in the  meeting  would understand,
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
        
    
    
      
    
    
      and then everyone would say, "What was that again?" and then they'd pronounce it in English and so I could
    
    
      Oh, eh - 
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      figure out what it was 
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      that way.
    
    
      Yeah, interesting.
    
    
       Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Yeah, I mean he was never like - it was never up to like a native speaker, but like that - it got a little easier.
    
    
      
    
    
      Like his English fluency got better?
    
    
      Um - I remember in the beginning you had - and you were just sorta like - you were  beating   your head against the wall, but I - it go- but it got better, it got better.
    
    
      Oh, I went  crazy. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      I - I would
    
    
      skip doing that
    
    
      Yeah, I know. Yeah.  I remember.
    
    
      portion for as long as I could because
    
    
      i-
    
    
      I just couldn't deal with it, and -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, I had the same experience.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Sometimes - And actually -
    
    
      Sometimes  when people lack a certain level of fluency you can ask them  themselves,  "What did you  say  there?" and they can't  tell  you.
    
    
      And they won't know.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      S- I think it's - it's sort of a general variability when it's not - when you're learning a language and you haven't gotten to a certain level.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm. Yeah.
    
    
       @@ 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      I also wonder if - if it's partly that Span- Spanish has
    
    
      different pronunciations in different regions? I mean, do you think that, um,
    
    
      that, uh,
    
    
      maybe - I mean, being -
    
    
       I mean, not that I would know that.  But I just wondered if, um -
    
    
      
    
    
       Mmm .
    
    
       you know, she was from
    
    
      probably continental Spain versus   y- you know other Spanish -
    
    
      I wonder if that would have a -
    
    
      a contributing factor.
    
    
        
    
    
      I don't know.
    
    
      Oh, like the region?
    
    
      I have no idea about Spain, but I know that in France for example
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Parisian French is much easier for me to understand cuz I  learned  it versus
    
    
      France in like Marseilles or in the south or in like the provin- like
    
    
        
    
    
      Sure.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
       the   villages  in the south, it's really hard to understand.
    
    
       Menton.   
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      Or in Quebec, right? In Canada it'd be - it's different. A lot of the pronunciations are different, yeah.
    
    
      That's right.
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Much different. Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      And in my case with - with, uh, German w- I - a certain region that I do well in and then  get farther away from that region and I notice it's more and more difficult. Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      There's another language that's spoken in Spain too, that's um, what am I thinking of?
    
    
      Castillian?
    
    
      Castillian. Yeah, and uh,
    
    
      And -
    
    
      um -
    
    
      isn't it Catalan?
    
    
      Catalan.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
       So maybe - I mean, depending on where she is, like maybe
    
    
      
    
    
       But she was also very low volume. 
    
    
      ch-
    
    
      And, um - and didn't say a lot. I mean, I - I - I c- I totally agree. This was a - a difficult person to - to understand.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Well, the last one I did she actually said a  lot,  and it was kinda - it was very hard to transcribe.
    
    
      But.
    
    
      You kno- it was - i- j- I just think that, um, her fluency in English wasn't -
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      wa- um,
    
    
      wasn't very -
    
    
      
    
    
      very high up there, so it was  really 
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      difficult. But, I mean, I did
    
    
      find that  knowing  Spanish helped me a  lot.  I could tell that a  lot  of things that the other transcriber had put in  parentheses,  I was like, "I can see how you -
    
    
      I can imagine that, yeah.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      You were able to figure out. 
    
    
      how you couldn't understand that", but I c-
    
    
      
    
    
      I kn- I think I know what she's doing.  I mean, I think I know the mistake she's making. And -
    
    
      Yeah, yeah, yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      That's really good. Yeah, cuz that's definitely something that I wouldn't have be able to do. 
    
    
      Yeah, yeah. 
    
    
       Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, I couldn't do it in Spanish. I've - I  found  myself doing that somewhat in - in  German. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      German. 
    
    
      In German, yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      There were problems even with, um, Am- English speakers though. I mean, not in their level of fluency, obviously, but in -
    
    
      
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Some people tend to  mumble,  
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm. That's right.
    
    
      and -
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      and it's hard to catch
    
    
      what it  is  is, cuz it goes by really quickly and you can't really  tell  and -
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      Or they're laughing when they're talking or they're - 
    
    
      That  too. 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      That too.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Or just -
    
    
      
    
    
      I don't know. And some people tend to get interrupted more,  I know that's not something that the person themselves can control but -
    
    
      
    
    
      He- yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
       Hmm .
    
    
      If - when people talk over one another like  constantly,   like there's this whole barrage of voices coming from  everywhere,  
    
    
      um -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      it's like "Oh my God! What's going on right now?" 
    
    
      
    
    
      Especially when they're - when you  were using the l- the mikes that weren't m- headmounted mikes.
    
    
      It's kind of - 
    
    
      Oh. Yeah.
    
    
      And there was input from other people on the same channel as the person who was talking.
    
    
        
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, we had lapels for d- l- brief- And then sometimes people would wear these around their necks,
    
    
      And that was really hard to deal with.
    
    
      
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      which would mean really basically
    
    
      u- uh,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      a problem that you're saying of getting input from others, and also,
    
    
      Oh, yeah.
    
    
      Mmm. 
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      um, it varying when they change their hea- w- head position.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, but -
    
    
      Right. A big im- I tha- I think the transcriptions improved immensely,
    
    
      like exponentially, um, after it was able to sort of isolate a single person onto a single channel.
    
    
      Yeah, absolutely.
    
    
      Oh, excellent. Oh, good to know.
    
    
      Um -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Oh, there's no question. Um -
    
    
      Oh, yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      S-
    
    
      so that was - You're talking about early on, the change fro- into Channeltrans? Mm-hmm.
    
    
        
    
    
       Yeah. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      You guys didn't have
    
    
      o- one channel per  person  before?
    
    
       No. 
    
    
      
    
    
      No, it was one like - one ribbon for everybody and you had to kind of - you could switch signals, like you could  listen  to a different one, but you couldn't really -
    
    
       No. 
    
    
      Oh, wow.
    
    
      Euh. 
    
    
        
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Well  could  you? Did - we didn't  do  that very much.
    
    
      You couldn't  visually  isolate it?
    
    
       What? 
    
    
      You couldn't  visually  do it, no.
    
    
      Huh.
    
    
      Euh. 
    
    
      No.
    
    
      And f- Yeah. 
    
    
      And you had to mark interruptions by a  slash,  right?
    
    
      Mm-hmm, that's right.
    
    
      And it was very hard to be precise about it, and it was very hard to tell -
    
    
      Um -
    
    
      Overlaps.
    
    
      I had so much trouble at the very beginning trying to figure out who was who. 
    
    
      Mmm. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mmm. 
    
    
      Cuz there's m- so many men and so few women. The women were easy to f- figure out who was who,
    
    
      and then the  men  - all their voices sounded the  same  except I think there was one British English speaker
    
    
      and that was easy but
    
    
      Wow, that's difficult.
    
    
      Eh.  - Yeah.
    
    
      You know what? There might be a gender thing there, though, too, cuz I think -
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      I think as women it might be easier to differentiate - Well, there were fewer women, too, but I - I wonder if a man transcribing all the guys  would have had -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Like if you  had transcribed it you would have had an easier time differentiating them? 
    
    
      An easier time?
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      I don't know  why  that would be  true,  but
    
    
      That's interesting.
    
    
      That's possible.
    
    
      That's possible. 
    
    
      you wonder if there'd be like a  gender  difference there?  I don't know, I'm thinking about it as like a psychologist I suppose.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      It's  possible.   Hmm. 
    
    
      I don't know.
    
    
      Anyway. 
    
    
      Well, it's -
    
    
      
    
    
      oh, yeah, yeah, that's possible.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I was just gonna say something. I was gonna say that,
    
    
      I mean, it's easier for people to mimic like the  timbre  of
    
    
      somebody's voice if it's the same - if,
    
    
      
    
    
      uh, that person's voice is the same -
    
    
      if that person is the same  sex  as  you.  So maybe,
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      like, implicitly people pay attention more closely to
    
    
      uh, speakers of the same sex.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      I don't know. I don't know if that's actually true but I'm just
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      throwing that out there.
    
    
      It's interesting.
    
    
      Huh.
    
    
      I don't know.
    
    
      Huh.
    
    
      
    
    
      Kind of an interesting research project. 
    
    
      Yeah, it seems like it's - it's related to this
    
    
      production idea.
    
    
      How you -
    
    
      you internalize what you're externalizing in a way,  but.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, but it definitely got much better when that change happened.
    
    
      Oh yeah, it was so ea- it - it became much easier.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Um, you know.
    
    
      In the prev- You've  also  gone through - They've  been here since the beginning.  You've also gone through the - use the int- in- in- introduction of the pre-segmentation, and  that  kind of thing.
    
    
        
    
    
        
    
    
      Oh, yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
       Right. 
    
    
      So initially they had to actually mark all the time bins themselves as well.
    
    
      Wow. 
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      Oh, wow.
    
    
       Right.
    
    
      That took a l-
    
    
      Which wasn't  as  hard. I mean, it took time. It took time.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      E- No.  It just took time. Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Um, I find that I have to  adjust  the time bins a lot  anyway.  Um -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Me too, yeah. Yeah.
    
    
      Me too.
    
    
      Yeah, I always adjust the time bins.
    
    
       Yeah.  
    
    
      Um, not for the  end  of the utterance but for the  beginning.  Sometimes the beginning -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       I see.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Really?
    
    
      the person started to say something, it's a very slight difference,  and then the time bin starts.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah, that happens a lot.
    
    
      Yeah right.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Um, so you have to just move it back a little bit.
    
    
      And besi- and I think you  mentioned at some point that you wanted a little pad
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      of time anyway.
    
    
      It doesn't hurt to have a pad. It's - it's nicer to have a pad than not, d- but s- don't have to be really - Yeah, don't - doesn't have to be -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Then to have it be cut off.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Don't have it just start, yeah.
    
    
      I always wonder about the, um, time bins. I mean, I usually ended adjusting them a little bit - I mean,
    
    
      I thought -
    
    
      Um, so.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      definitely when something's cut off at the beginning or the end but also sometimes there's just like
    
    
      huge pads of, you know,
    
    
      air before and - or  after,  um, that I don't really feel
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      is necessary for that segment, and I usually, um, you know,
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Shrink in them or whatever, yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      shrink it a bit and make it a little bit -
    
    
      Nice.
    
    
      Seems like I always have to cut off pads at the  end. 
    
    
      Nice.
    
    
      I don't have so much problem at the beginning, but.
    
    
      Of  breath  or of  uh  - nothing?
    
    
      No, of n- just nothing. Yeah.
    
    
      Just nothing, yeah.
    
    
      Hmm, yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, there's nothing going on.
    
    
      At the beginning it seems to happen when, um, voicing occurs later -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      l- you know, like -
    
    
      With fricatives a lot.
    
    
      Yeah, with fricatives and with like, uh - I mean, like i- it doesn't happen with, uh, like "buh" 
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      so much because you've got the pre-voicing before the consonant actually begins.
    
    
      Although I found one in - actually I was just working right before this meeting,  one where someone said, "great" and
    
    
      the -
    
    
      the G_ - it was pronounced as a K_ so it was unvoiced and then part of the R_ was cut off in the beginning.
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      And then
    
    
      you - It sounded like "great" if you just listened to that time bin it still  sounded  like "great".
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      But if you listened to right  before  it you could hear a little the - the K_ or whatever and a little bit of the R_.  So -
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      I don't know. Usually it's not - usually that doesn't happen but this time it did.
    
    
      That's kind of interesting.
    
    
        I - 
    
    
      So for the non-linguists, what's a fricative?
    
    
      Ah. 
    
    
      Oh. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Uh, it's like "fff", "sss".  
    
    
      Or "sss".  
    
    
      Or -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Oh, O_K.
    
    
      Or "thh".  
    
    
      "Shh".  
    
    
       It's a sound that -
    
    
      It's like the noisy, uh, um, like airflow ones where you've got like a - a stoppage in your mouth like, uh, like your tongue -
    
    
      But it's not completely blocking the airflow.
    
    
      Oh, I see.
    
    
      Yeah, and you can sort of - you can sort of keep it going a little bit.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Oh, I see.
    
    
      Unlike like a "tuh" or a "kuh" that just stops.
    
    
      Oh, O_K.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Got it.
    
    
      
    
    
      Sorry. 
    
    
      I guess I'm the only non-linguist. 
    
    
      Have you -
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Well, I'm - I'm sort of a hybrid, so I - I - you know, I - I appreciate having them do this, yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Oh, right, yeah, oh you - Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      So, um, in - did you - have you run into places - I've run into a couple where actually the word was totally  different  when you adjusted the time bin. Have you had that happen?
    
    
      Mmm, yeah.
    
    
      Oh, yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      That's  fascinating. 
    
    
      Yeah. I like that.  I think that's fun.  
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Oh, it's really a kick.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      And it sometimes changes the entire utterance, too.
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh it does.  Completely. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, I - I don't remember the words exactly. It's a shame. There was one that was a whole sentence was broken up in the middle,
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      and there was a little
    
    
      like
    
    
       millisecond  of break in the middle.
    
    
      And
    
    
      if you connected it all together, it completely changed what was right before it and what was right after  it. It was written as something else, and then
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      it became a
    
    
      word together from what was before and after and then with this little tiny
    
    
      millisecond pause. 
    
    
      
    
    
      So I guess - I don't  know.  I mean, I guess when we talk
    
    
      in between
    
    
      different
    
    
      segments of the  word  maybe,  there's  pauses  somehow,  I guess - or the - you can -
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      We stop voicing sometimes.
    
    
      Yeah, or  something  like that.
    
    
      It's probably like inaudible
    
    
      for us but -
    
    
      And maybe the pause was just so short that
    
    
      it made up a
    
    
      pause. I don't - is - it - That doesn't make any sense, but. 
    
    
      There  are  some times when there have been  words  that they just pause right in the  middle  of. You're -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      i- it's h-
    
    
      On  purpose,  though.
    
    
      Or not.
    
    
      
    
    
      Well, 
    
    
      it ge- u- I'm sure sometimes on purpose, but sometimes it'd just be s- saying something and especially people who have really lo- elongation in their style,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      and they say, "That's really  fascinating"   
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      It's not a great example, but you know?
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Sh- 
    
    
      And -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Uh there's - it's -
    
    
      it's funny how, um,
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      i- it's funny to me that th- something like that, you just change one little boundary and suddenly the whole meaning changes and I've run across that also.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, that is true.
    
    
      Hmm. Would you want, um,
    
    
      uh,
    
    
      a  transcription  of something like that, of a big pause in between - in the middle of a word? Or just leave it as, "fascinating"?
    
    
      What I've done - I've - It's very rare. I mean, when I've run across it.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      And, you know, maybe there are times that I haven't detected it and I'm not  -
    
    
      you know, fin- I haven't looked at  everything.  I've looked at - I've probably
    
    
      looked at per- uh s- at least eighty percent of the data,
    
    
      you know, all the way through e- every meeting -  for about eighty percent of the stuff that I've cleared so far.
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh! 
    
    
      And, um,
    
    
      i- it s- You guys are getting so good that it's like I'm -
    
    
      I - I - i- I can get through them faster, and I'm getting to the point where I maybe don't have to go  through  them all the way, you know, so it's like -
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      it's just we've gotten to a level, it's just really great,  of, um,
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      of - of
    
    
      
    
    
      pre- precision that
    
    
      um, it takes a lot of a load off of me. And, um -
    
    
      and so I'm not gonna be checking them all I don't think in the   for throughout the whole rest of the project.
    
    
      But, um -
    
    
      
    
    
      Certainly have spot checking. 
    
    
      
    
    
      But, um, hhh,  those that I  have  found that way,  to me, I think f- f- the most sensible way to handle it from  my  perspective was to treat it as a  pronunciation  situation.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      So just do a - you know, a mark, then "fascinating", and then put "P_R_N"  and  uh "interrupted by a pause" or, you know, some kind of other gloss like that, you know.
    
    
      Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
    
    
      P_R_N.
    
    
      How it was really pronounced?
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
       Mm-hmm. 
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Mmm, oh right.
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      You know, "P_R_ dot dot fascinating", whatever it is.
    
    
      I always get confused with the
    
    
      
    
    
      pronunciation
    
    
      convention.
    
    
      Sorry, what was this?
    
    
      I get confused with pronunciation, like when there's a strange pronunciation that I wanna mark. 
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      
    
    
      Because I think w-
    
    
      m- may- di- in the beginning did we do
    
    
      the strange pronunciation and then write P_R_N and what it really was meant to be? And now we're doing the normal word and then inside the brackets
    
    
      what it sounded like?
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      We did a switch, right?
    
    
      Or not. I don't know if it's just me that's confused or if it was swi-
    
    
      Well, I've -
    
    
      Mm-hmm, I - it - it never occurred to me, but now that you're  mentioning  it, n- yeah, yeah,  possibly. 
    
    
      There was an adjustment, and I - and I've switched them all - all the way at this point so that
    
    
       O_K.
    
    
      O_K. So the convention as it stands now is
    
    
      write the word as it is normally conventionally spelled in English with the little
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      
    
    
      apostrophe, or whatever you call it,
    
    
      Mm-hmm, that's right.
    
    
      and then
    
    
      "P_R_N",
    
    
      And then in the brackets, what it - Uh-huh. So i- you know, "O_K" is a very
    
    
      how it's pronounced.
    
    
      
    
    
      e- easy example. A person says, "Mm-kay" then,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      it's "O_K" with a ha- a little hatch and then,
    
    
      "P_R_N" and then "m- mm-kay", or whatever it is in quotes.
    
    
      Oh, right.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Oh. Right.
    
    
      I think  Nelson's  the only one who, uh - Oh,  Morgan. 
    
    
      You guys call him Morgan.
    
    
      Yeah, yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      He's the only one who ever  did  that, I think. " Mm-kay. "
    
    
      He does it a lot. 
    
    
      "Mm-kay" - I -
    
    
      He does it a - yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
       O_K.  
    
    
      Yeah, and some people just say, "Kay."
    
    
      Um -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      "Kay", yeah, that's true.
    
    
      Yeah, that's right.
    
    
      S-
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      And of course, you know - I mean, there's also this other reduction that
    
    
      w- that we've done in terms of like not capturing every time a person says "and" versus "nnn"  versus, you know, "nd",  whatever - all the different ways of reducing "and".
    
    
        
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      That's true.
    
    
      Because you can assume that
    
    
      
    
    
      the speech recognition,
    
    
      um,
    
    
      
    
    
      uh, pronunciation models will handle a certain amount of reductions of these types, and the same thing for,
    
    
      
    
    
      um, well "the". "The"  versus "the"  that there are those known variants, and -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
       Or "a"  versus "a". 
    
    
      Exactly.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      And that they should be able to handle themselves, and - and that we assume also that
    
    
      
    
    
      for discourse purposes, those distinctions are not really the focus right now, and
    
    
      
    
    
      those distinctions could be added later if needed but it's unlikely that they would be. And it's so time-consuming. So we've made these - these simplifying assumptions with  that,  and so then you begin to think, "Well what  about  "O_K"? I mean, maybe
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      "mm-kay" is an appropriate variant for "O_K" and it wouldn't be necessary to mark those either, so it's -
    
    
       it's definitely - there's a, uh,
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      choice of how far you go with that, and whether "kay" is - is enough of a variant -
    
    
      you know, it's - th- this is a case where,
    
    
      um, I appreciate it when people mark those kinds of things but I - I sort of figure that
    
    
      i-  
    
    
      that - that's
    
    
      not as far aw- away from "O_K" as "mm-kay" is, so it's not quite so -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      but I don't change it back if it's there, you know.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      I think with like some of  them   - like
    
    
      you know with uh the difference between "the"  and "the", 
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      you can -
    
    
      you can distinguished very, uh, u-
    
    
      dif- definitively like what context they're gonna be used in.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Like um,  like you would say "the  apple" because it's "the" plus then the next word starts with a vowel.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Or "the cat" because  it's  next word starts with a -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      There's a study done on when people say "uh" and when people say "um".
    
    
      Yeah, I'm sure it's -
    
    
      Also, there's contec- in concet- contextual variation,
    
    
       Oh, really?
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      and it's predictable apparently, I haven't read the -
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
       I was trying to figure that out myself a couple times,
    
    
      
    
    
      It's really interesting.
    
    
      But something like - Yeah.
    
    
      and I couldn't get anything.  I kept looking at all the "uh's" and "um's" and I was like, " Oh,  this would be  hard  to do."
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm, interesting.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Oh, that's interesting. Huh.
    
    
      You know, what's - On that
    
    
      sort of similar topic, I just thought of something that's been hard for me sometimes, is
    
    
      you can have a pronunciation of - of the word "a" 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      as "a". 
    
    
      And then you can have "uh" like
    
    
      a pause or whatever as "uh", and sometimes it's hard to tell
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      what the person meant. Are - did they mean "uh" like they're pausing or did they mean "a" like "a
    
    
      
    
    
      Mmm, yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      person"? 
    
    
      I've run into that.
    
    
      Really?
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
       Once  in a while.
    
    
      And
    
    
      I don't usually get con-
    
    
      you can kind of tell from the context but sometimes it's hard, yeah.
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah, that came up a couple of times, yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, I -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Huh.
    
    
      I agree. And - and when I - when I'm  totally  in doubt, if there's a case where it really could be  either,  and I could flip a coin,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      I'll choose the one that would make syntactically the most sense, give  them   the benefit of the doubt that they're being fluent about it.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      Sometimes I'll put in like a bracket like
    
    
      
    
    
      uh, you know, the orthographic A_ slash U_H
    
    
      like if I'm really confused.
    
    
      Like you can't tell, mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah, kinda go "Well there's two, so here." 
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      It must be really rare though, I haven't run across that often.
    
    
      
    
    
      Ha- ha- h- Is it rare?
    
    
      Mmm-mm. 
    
    
      A  few  times.
    
    
      A few. It's really - yeah, relatively rare.
    
    
       It's rare.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      I don't think I ever have.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah. I mean I can only think of
    
    
      like two or three occasions where I sat and thought about it for a while.
    
    
      
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Other times just
    
    
      you figure -
    
    
      you look at it  and  what's the context.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      It's O_K, I don't know.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      O_K. Well, le- let's see now, there's another - another methodo- what I go- I wanna ask you at some point, it just occurred to me,  I'd like to ask you the following question, maybe you can have this in the back of your minds,
    
    
      Huh.
    
    
      something like, um,
    
    
      you know, what sorts of hypothesis - your hypothesis about the - you know, ti-  trying  to find the distributional  explanations  for some of these things.
    
    
       Right. 
    
    
      What kind of, uh, hypotheses have - has this caused you - uh, I mean, don't wanna
    
    
      
    
    
      have you give away a paper topic that you wanna explore,  but,
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      you know, if  there's  interesting th- uh, hypotheses that the - that y- have been suggested to you by looking at the data. That kinda thing, maybe,
    
    
      uh, at  some  point. So, 
    
    
      Hnh.
    
    
      and al- Oh! And I also wanna say, that, um, I'd like to meet again also next week, 
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      um, and I don't know if this is a good time frame, 
    
    
        
    
    
      uh, maybe it'd be good to have it an hour later or - I don't know - I mean, could do  anything 
    
    
      
    
    
      about -
    
    
      This is fine.
    
    
      This time is fine for me.
    
    
      Yeah, this is a good time for me.
    
    
      Good time for you?
    
    
      It  should  be.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
       
    
    
      Um, I know I have something in the  morning,  which I  don't  normally have.
    
    
      I  don't  remember off the top of my head when it  ends.  
    
    
      Um, I'll let you know if it's - it'll be a  problem  but it  should  be O_K.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Two-thirty should be late enough. So.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Excellent, cuz we could probably move it one hour later, I mean - I think,  u-  unless -
    
    
      In m-
    
    
      
    
    
      I was just gonna say maybe fifteen minutes later would help me a little bit just cuz I have a class up at Dwinelle b- just before this. That's why I was a little late today because -
    
    
      Oh, I  see.  
    
    
       Wow.   You did really  well.   Yeah.
    
    
      Thanks.  Well, I took the bus for part of the way. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh, did  you?   O_K, O_K.
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      But um, that might help me just a  little  bit because then it -
    
    
      
    
    
      I - you know, I'm gonna - gonna be hobbling a little slowly.
    
    
      
    
    
      Then you don't have to rush.
    
    
      Would anybody be constrained by having it be a full half hour later?
    
    
      
    
    
      Hnh-nn. 
    
    
      No.
    
    
      No.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      And th- the final question i- 
    
    
      No.
    
    
      Except we'll miss  treat  time.
    
    
        Oh!
    
    
       
    
    
      Tea!
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh, that's right! Oh!  I thought she said "mistreat time". 
    
    
       Oh no. 
    
    
       Yeah. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Maybe we could have like a -
    
    
      Mistreat? Oh! 
    
    
      like a half hour, then take a little break,  then come back and finish the meet-
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, well that's - that's some good motivation to not start a half hour later. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      You know what we could do?
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, you know, that's - that's - that's an interesting -
    
    
      We could just ask the -
    
    
       someone  like the front desk person or Lila to like set aside a little bit for us.
    
    
      
    
    
      Tha- that's so funny. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Little bit of treats.
    
    
      Hey, they  would. 
    
    
      Oh  that's  true.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah, they would. That's - that's not a bad solution.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      It's not gonna be birthday cake, so.
    
    
      Yeah, so we'll survive.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       Yeah, that's right, it's already done. 
    
    
      This is very important.  
    
    
      
    
    
       It's good to s- good to have these things all scheduled. 
    
    
      
    
    
      O_K, so um - Oh,
    
    
      uh, eh then I was gonna ask you, what about an hour later? I mean, if we h- had those things an hour later like, would people - O_K?
    
    
      
    
    
      This is fine with me.
    
    
      That's fine too.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      O_K, good. Alright, so, I'll - I'll so- settle on that. O_K now, I wanted to say, you've been through a couple of different, uh,  improvements in the methods, the pre-segmentation.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Yeah. That's fine.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      There was another impro- another improvement in that -
    
    
      Well, s- let's ask if it was an improvement from your standpoint.
    
    
       Uh , the  Tigerfish,  um, approach. So,
    
    
      uh, s- moving from having the first transcription done by an external service, and then you
    
    
       correcting  that versus doing the initial transcription  yourselves. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Ho- ho- how - Have you - And so I think you - Yeah, I think you -
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh. 
    
    
      Did you -
    
    
      I don't think I have ever
    
    
      has there already been t-
    
    
      done one from an external -
    
    
      I have.
    
    
      I th- I feel like they've all been done probably by
    
    
      another transcriber here. 
    
    
      You talking about the I_B_M ones?
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, I_B_M or if - if it was dash T_F, that's the Tigerfish.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      T-
    
    
      Right, yeah, oh, yeah yeah.
    
    
      Oh, m- yeah, then I guess I have. Maybe the o- one I'm working on now.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      I could tell you something that I thought -
    
    
      So d-
    
    
      They have different - definitely a different style, right?
    
    
      Do they end all - them all in  dots,  like dot dot?
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      There's a lot of that. Yeah.
    
    
       Yes.
    
    
      Yeah, mm-hmm.
    
    
      They  used  to.
    
    
      I  really  th-
    
    
      And they - and they capitalize like every single first - 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      And they put paren- um,  not  parentheses. What's it called? 
    
    
      Punctuation after brackets.
    
    
      Yeah, that's right too.
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      
    
    
       
    
    
      Oh, O_K, yeah, then I'm doing that right now.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Oh, right, "Laugh, period".
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
       Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.  Which makes no sense to me. Like " that's  not a syntactic part of that sentence". 
    
    
      Something like that, right?
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      
    
    
      No it doesn't to me either but.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      If -
    
    
      No. 
    
    
      Exactly. Exactly, I'm glad you - Yeah, exactly.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Well, they're not linguists, so. 
    
    
      if -
    
    
       No.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      if I could be completely frank, I really didn't like the I_B_M ones.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Oh, good to know.
    
    
      Yeah. I found them to be just -
    
    
      I didn't either.
    
    
      Oh, that's helpful.
    
    
      I just - I - I ended up basically redoing them.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Um, like from start to finish, so when I was checking them like it would take me basically as long as it would have taken me to just to transcribe it by myself.
    
    
       I  don't know if I  did  one. 
    
    
      Wow. Wow!
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      I think it was a  little  bit faster than just transcribing it, but I definitely saw a lot of -
    
    
      Wow, O_K.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      I'm really picky. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      there was a lot of errors that are not in the Tigerfish ones.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah, Tigerfish are better.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      And they just have better intuitions, or I don't know  what  but, about what's  said. 
    
    
      O_K-
    
    
      Which are -  What  are the two differences? I'm not sure.
    
    
      
    
    
       I'm  not sure if you  had  an I_B_M one. So this was earlier  on.
    
    
      So do I have a Tigerfish one right  now? 
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      If it says "T_F".
    
    
      If it says "T_F".
    
    
      You probably do.
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Yeah. The ones that say "I_B_M" are like - They actually say "I_B_M".
    
    
      So I don't think I've ever -
    
    
      The I_B_M ones were the ones that came in huge, huge paragraphs, huh?
    
    
      Yes! Yeah, and you have to parse  them   all down. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
    
    
       Yeah, and we had to split them up.
    
    
      See, I never got one of those.
    
    
      Right, O_K, yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I didn't g- ever get one of those. No. I'm glad I didn't. 
    
    
      So you didn't get one? Oh, interesting.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      I didn't get one either.
    
    
      I think those show up in Tigerfish too, cuz I think I've had a couple of Tigerfish where I've had to break  them   up.
    
    
      
    
    
      Where they have li-
    
    
      Ye-
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, but they're  not  like -
    
    
      They're not -
    
    
      they're not huge huge, though.
    
    
      Yeah, I can remember, u- I used to see -
    
    
      A  couple  were. Yeah. And I had to sorta break  them   down.
    
    
      Really?
    
    
      Oh. 
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      Do they get them, um -
    
    
      I don't know.
    
    
      Id- Is -
    
    
      They don't have like an interface, right? They just -
    
    
      No.
    
    
      In neither case. And I'm - and I'm thinking - I'm thinking - you're causing me to think back over what the differences were in the - what they got and I_B_M didn't -
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
        
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      They just have - They just have it  segmented.  You can  tell  because
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      sometimes they have it so wrong and it's like, "Well, if you had just  listened  to what was  before ". 
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.  But they don't have that option. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, but they don't have that. Yeah, I figured that they didn't. 
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      There's also some i- iffiness about
    
    
      Als-
    
    
      
    
    
      how d- if - We're not sure really how Tigerfish  does  it, you know, the  methodology.  How do they  do  this. Because sometimes you'll have the s- the same word, and I've seen this,  like, within -
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      well, within a  single  turn,
    
    
      l- it'll be spelled in three different  ways. 
    
    
      And it's like, you know, is this the same person who's kind of forgetful,  or is it that they have several people doing it together?  You know, maybe it's  parallel.  Maybe they're all doing it in  parallel  and one falls behind and the other one - 
    
    
      Huh.
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Oh,  that's  interesting.
    
    
      But, who  knows? 
    
    
      And they don't - One person doesn't listen to all the channels of one  meeting,  right?
    
    
      
    
    
      So they can't get clues from the other channels? 
    
    
      Well, you know, the - The way  they're  listening to it is
    
    
      Or  can  they? I don't know. Mm-hmm.
    
    
      they -
    
    
      they get a - they get - It's linearized. So
    
    
      if you picture what we have on the screen,
    
    
      um, you know, there's this block and it goes over - 
    
    
      I'm doing it from  my  perspective.  You have this block and it goes over to here and stops and this person starts to talk and he goes over to here and then you have an overlap over here. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      And so what they would get is  this  block from the  first  guy,  this  block from the  second  guy, and  then  the  top  of the overlap and then the  second  guy in the overlap.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      Oh, wow.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      And then it would move  on.  So it's sort of like this - you know, you go this way as much as you can, then you cycle through there and then you go up to this next level and -
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      So they hear all the channels at once like you guys were saying  you  first did?
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh, O_K.
    
    
      
    
    
      Um, let's see, they hear  them   - Oh!
    
    
      uh, they hear  them   separately in two chunks, but then  sometimes 
    
    
      they get confused about who the foreground  speaker  is, because they're not being  told  who the foreground speaker is.
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      You know, and  especially  you can see if you have like  four  speakers, it be reason- you can maybe find a way of doing that. But with  nine  speakers - 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Eee!  Yeah. 
    
    
      So what they get is they get a  beep 
    
    
      that tells them when there's something that  they  think - that the
    
    
      f- pre-segmenter thought there should be s- transcribed in there.
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      And - so they'll get -
    
    
      
    
    
      And it's  numbered  so that we end up with the same number of - of transcribed  slots.  
    
    
      As there are slots in the pre-segmentation.  Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Exactly. Cuz the  first  time when we didn't have  them    numbered, 
    
    
      we ended up with a  couple extra  segments that were transcribed, and it was hard to patch the whole thing back  together  because when it comes back to  our  end,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      um, it's just this long  string  of  things  that they've
    
    
      uh, partitioned according to the
    
    
       tape  that they were given.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Cuz they don't - they  actually   don't have digital interface  either  so it's - it's audiotape.
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh wow.
    
    
      Huh.
    
    
      Oh, wow.
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      Hmm, wow.
    
    
      And they type it on and then - then it comes back to us and Adam and Thilo have a program wa- they put it back together into  our  interface format and then we can  use  it. But,
    
    
      Makes it really hard.
    
    
      Wow.
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      um, 
    
    
       
    
    
      um,  there are f- cases where you'll get a segment and it's someone else's  utterance  and that's because
    
    
      
    
    
      that was overlapping with someone  else  and this is the weaker  speaker  of the two, and you'll have like two totally parallel
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      r- renditions of the same thing.
    
    
      Because
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      i- it's just - i- n-  So what they get is like - i- t- is they get something like "beep one".
    
    
      And then - then they get "beep two", "beep three". Chuck Wooters does the numbers.
    
    
      And, um, it cycles through.
    
    
      Wow.
    
    
      Oh, so they don't - Do they know the names of the  speakers? 
    
    
      No.
    
    
      Oh, O_K.
    
    
      And they don't know which channel is s- l- supposed to be together.
    
    
      Cuz - y- O_K.
    
    
       Huh. 
    
    
      Cuz  sometimes  there'd just be interesting things where
    
    
      there'd be a misunderstanding about like -
    
    
      like
    
    
      Morgan would be speaking but it'd be on  your   channel,  and it'd be like, " This  is  clearly   not  a  woman   speaking. "
    
    
      Yes,  exactly. 
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
       Yeah, that's quite right. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      It's like, " How  could they  do  that?" It's like - Well now it's - it m- seems more reasonable that they'd make a mistake like that if they had  no   idea. 
    
    
      And that's why.
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Exactly right.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      God, it must  take  them a  really  long time to  do  these.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Um.
    
    
      They're very fast. Is l-
    
    
      That's  amazing.  It sounds so  hard. 
    
    
      Yeah. Yeah.
    
    
      It - it turns out that they're really  much  faster than the other approaches we've  used,  and
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      we don't know exactly how they do it and I think that that's by  intention,  that -  - not just me who thinks that - it's that
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      proprietarily, it's a very competitive business and they probably don't wanna,
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Huh.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      uh,
    
    
      Leak their secrets?
    
    
      say too much about it. Yeah. Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      But they're very fast. It's uh -
    
    
      Well, I -  I  definitely prefer not doing the transcript- I mean, I  liked  transcribing  because I felt like I was much closer to the data 
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      and I had a lot more ideas,  like you were saying, hypotheses of what's going on and - 
    
    
      
    
    
      Huh.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      but
    
    
      it took a really long time and I'd get frustrated with it.
    
    
      And I think that I would lose my -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I don't know, I would
    
    
      not be as thorough, not be as careful.
    
    
       I  kinda  miss  it.
    
    
      Excellent. Uh-huh.
    
    
      
    
    
      I  liked  - Yeah, I  liked  transcribing.
    
    
      You miss - Oh! I  see.  Oh,  interesting. 
    
    
      
    
    
      I kinda did too.
    
    
      Yeah, I liked transcribing.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      I - You know, I feel -
    
    
       I feel like it was, um,
    
    
      more  personal.  I was -
    
    
      It  was  more personal.  Yeah.
    
    
      You know, the - n- This is sort of just, you know, correcting other - I feel like I'm just sort of like correcting a test or something now, 
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      you know, that somebody's already done, and -
    
    
      Oh, how interesting. Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      But, I mean, it's still -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      It's still cool.
    
    
      But, um, yeah, I did - I did like actually doing the transcribing
    
    
      You don't tend to notice as much I don't think at checking as you do transcribing, because it's already  there  so you don't have to pay as much attention.
    
    
      a little bit more.
    
    
      That's true.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, O_K.
    
    
      Yeah, and when you're -
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      when you're, um, just checking you're - You're usually just looking for certain things that you know are gonna come up, and
    
    
      
    
    
      I usually assume that, um, the words are mostly right, although I g- you know, I go through and I look and make sure all the words are right, but usually it's like, punctuation and capitalization and
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      other things that I'm - end up changing. And time bins, yeah.
    
    
      And time bin corrections and things, yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I guess I'm such a perfectionist that I sort of combine
    
    
      the two when I'm checking, like I act as though I'm transcribing it.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Really?
    
    
      And so - Yeah, I really do. Like I'm - I tend to take a little  longer maybe than other people  doing checking but like I -
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      I'm like ultra-careful.  I - That's just how I am. But, like I -
    
    
      I think I really, like,
    
    
      think of it in terms of
    
    
       re-transcribing  it almost
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      and I only -
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      You know, b- So,
    
    
      like, I - I change time bins a  lot,  and I
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      like will change what people write -
    
    
      
    
    
      like for whatever words they write a  lot,  like -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      So, I guess I don't see
    
    
       too  much of a difference but that's just because it's  me.   Like I think I like checking more for that reason because
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      then it's sort of -
    
    
      it's like it's a - it's a little helpful. It's like kind of, you know, somebody's  helping  me a little bit, but I'm actually doing the work anyway,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      is kind of how I see it.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
       
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
       One  thing that's annoying I think with checking is that
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      a  lot  of times in the meetings you tend to have one or two people who talk a lot and the rest of the people just sit there until it's their turn to give their little report or whatever.
    
    
      
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Right. 
    
    
      And
    
    
      
    
    
      yet
    
    
      you have to check
    
    
      the channels for if they did backchannels or if they did other things that you need to
    
    
      encode that weren't on the pre-segmenter.  But
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      sometimes it's not visually easy.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      And so
    
    
      I'm -
    
    
      Sometime I debate with myself whether it's really worth it to sit there and listen to the whole thing 
    
    
      or risk missing a little bit and doing it visually. It's hard to decide sometimes.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      And this is when you crank up the visual. I mean, you've  still  got the  maximum  - Yeah. O_K.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And s-
    
    
      Yeah. Well, sometimes when you crank up the  visual   all it gives you is the background  speakers.  
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, that's the thing. i- that's the thing that makes it  harder  sometimes. 
    
    
        
    
    
      Yeah, it's true. It's true, it's just a big mess. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Or if they're breathing loudly.
    
    
      So.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, that's  right. 
    
    
      Well, i- it's a judgment call. And you can also say - well, you know, if the backchannels were so limit- so low on volume that
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      they weren't o- visually obvious, then you can say, "Well, it's reasonable not to worry about them."
    
    
      Yeah. The - I mean - but also  if   they have it all
    
    
      pre-segmented and they can only hear the  segments,  they often miss what's in  between  because they didn't even have the option of  listening  to what's in between.
    
    
      You mean the
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      transcribers? Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm, so. And you know, the - the segmenter usually misses little things like "mm-hmm" and "yeah" and -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, that's tr- right, That's quite right.
    
    
      
    
    
      And even bigger things.
    
    
      Yeah, that's right.
    
    
       yeah, sometimes the segmenter will -
    
    
      I mean  you've   said things that weren't caught on the pre-segmenter, like
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      whispers, kind of.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Just like,
    
    
      O_K. 
    
    
      "Oh, that's interesting", or something like that.
    
    
      Well, like little sighs, or like inbreaths, like as though you're gonna start speaking, which I feel is  important 
    
    
      Yeah, you're about to s- speak.
    
    
      Uh - 
    
    
      Yes, I agree.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      because it means that somebody's about to interject something but then they decide for whatever reason that they're not going to.
    
    
      But then they don't. 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      And oftentimes I find that the segmenter will miss those kind of things, those kind of vo- vocal cues.
    
    
      And sometimes even laughs.
    
    
        
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, breath-laughs especially.
    
    
       Oh, yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
    
    
      Oh yeah. 
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
        I  usually take out - um, I usually don't put in any of the breaths unless they're laughs.
    
    
      I usually don't transcribe the - the inbreaths or things like that.
    
    
      I don't either. M- but, I mean I don't take them out if they're already there.
    
    
       
    
    
      You know?
    
    
      I don't -
    
    
      c- Yeah. It's - it's good to -
    
    
      If it sounds like a  yawn.  I've transcribed  yawns, 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      um -
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      You can hear, there's like.  You know, it, like -  something like that.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      It - Well, it's communicative. Yeah.
    
    
      Uh -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah, or when it's a  laugh.  I mean,  often  in the  Tigerfish  there'd - it would si- say " breath ",
    
    
       Yeah.  
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      but it - it w- it actually seemed more like a  laugh. 
    
    
      It's really a laugh.
    
    
      It's a laugh, yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      But it's a laugh.
    
    
      It's actually a breath-laugh.
    
    
      Yeah. And you can -
    
    
      Um, cuz  everyone's   laughing.   Someone has just said something funny and everyone's like, "Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha".  Yeah.
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      And everyone else is laughing, and then the other person is like "ha-ha"  but it's not a actual laugh, but like -
    
    
      
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Right, it's - it's not a very  committed  laugh, but it's  still  a  laugh. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Right. 
    
    
      I don't know how you do it, you know?
    
    
      Right. 
    
    
      It's - No, like, yeah, it's like. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      It's like -
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      
    
    
      yeah, "I guess I'll laugh cuz everyone else is laughing," I - You know, who  knows,  but -
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      but yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Have you noticed that Tiger- I've noticed that Tigerfish uses " cough " a lot where it isn't really a  cough.   You notice that? Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       It should be "clear throat", or something.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.  Yeah. 
    
    
      Oh, yeah.
    
    
       Oh yeah, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Yeah, I - I just fix that.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
       Yeah.
    
    
      I'd fix that too.
    
    
      Yeah. Do you find - you've - i- This has caused me to wonder. So, in Tigerfish ones,
    
    
      do you find that where they've - where they have like "dot dot's" cuz it's segments they didn't  hear,  
    
    
      that - that you add -
    
    
      u- you probably do add things in those places where
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      it's -
    
    
      where  nothing  is transcribed really, because they didn't even  hear  it.
    
    
      You mean in between the segments that they  did  transcribe?
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       Oh. Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      That's where you f- tend to find -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Interesting.
    
    
      Oh, interesting. 
    
    
      Yeah, you find little lost - lost words in the middle.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Huh.
    
    
      
    
    
      Huh.
    
    
      It's - it depends on the person, I mean, some people don't tend to do -
    
    
      aren't that involved in the meeting, or something, and they don't tend to say as much, 
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      um, m- backchannels or whatever. And some people - I mean -
    
    
      I remember  transcribing  one  person, all they did was clear their throat and  breathe. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      And then read digits and then it was like the end of the meeting. 
    
    
      Yo- yo- yo. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      I think I know who you're talking about, but -
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      So. But then some people tend to -
    
    
      
    
    
      There's one guy in particular who does that. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      It's really cute actually. 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Uh - 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      But then there are some people who are - Even if they're not actually speaking,
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      you can tell they're more
    
    
      involved or interested or something, cuz they're always, "Mm-hmm, oh yeah, really, mm-hmm" - Um, reacting. Yeah.
    
    
      Reacting.
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      It just occurred to me, this is a - a different kind of question, but
    
    
      I w- 
    
    
      from having listened to all these people,
    
    
      I mean, and it  is  kind of ab- abnormal to be listening to them as if you're - they're talking into your ear, really. 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      You know, it's this really unusual acoustic circumstances.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Right. 
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      Um, 
    
    
      I sort of end up feeling like I  know  these people better than I really  do.  And it's like you go out to tea and there they are and, "Oh, you were so funny in that meeting" and it - it has this sort of
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      unusual dynamic because, you know, I - I'm privy to information which really by all rights I  shouldn't  be, except of course they - they agreed, they signed, they were there, they agreed.
    
    
      
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Right, yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      But - but it - but it's sort of an unusual relationship to say,
    
    
      you know, i- i- you know, if you're in the meeting  yourself,  then you - of  course  you'd have
    
    
      
    
    
      access to  all  this information and  all  your inferences about, you know, whether they're funny or not funny or whatever, but it -
    
    
      
    
    
      I remember from the very beginning, I
    
    
      would go to tea and start recognizing voices.
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh, that'd be interesting.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      And like turn around  and  be like,
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      "Wait,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      that person doesn't look  anything  like I imagined them."
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, yeah.  
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      a- eh -
    
    
      Y- you know who I kept wanting to meet? Was Bhaskara.
    
    
       Nnn.
    
    
      He's - he's on campus, I found this out. Yeah yeah yeah yeah.
    
    
      Is he really?
    
    
      He has such a nice voice. I really like his voice,  so I kept wanting to meet him.  And then John told me that he's not around anymore.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah. Nice guy.
    
    
      
    
    
      Nice guy.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh, but he is. I went on - I actually went on a hike with him two weeks - three weeks ago.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Or something, so.
    
    
      Neat.
    
    
      Oh, cool.
    
    
      Just curious. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah yeah. Yeah.
    
    
      Nice guy.
    
    
      I just wanted to know what Liz looked like. I've never gotten to see her.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Nn-mm. 
    
    
      Oh, she's here.
    
    
       I  haven't seen most of  them.  
    
    
      She's got a nice voice. I know she's here, I know she's a big part of the  Institute,  right? So.
    
    
      I haven't either.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, I'm sure you've seen her, uh but -
    
    
      Um -
    
    
      I must have, I just don't know who - you know, what she looks like.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Um -
    
    
      Yeah, I think she's got a nice voice.
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      But anyway.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      She always tends to get interrupted.
    
    
      It's O_K if we say  nice  things about these people, right? 
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       Yeah yeah, that's no problem. I also find that some of the - you know, if someone sits there and - and 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      it - th- there's this
    
    
      o- one who doesn't say much, but she just is always  pleasant.  You know, and it's kind of a smiling voice and she laughs and -
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      I th- I think I know who you're talking about.  
    
    
      What a difference.  Yeah.  I mean it's like -
    
    
      Actually it's - 
    
    
      
    
    
      um, she's - she's just so pleasant. And - and, you know,  adds  a lot just by virtue of that. You know, can - People will talk on all these technical things but she'll -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      she'll say something technical and then laugh, and -
    
    
      It's - it's very interesting, the ambience that you can get through these - these little things.
    
    
      Yeah.  
    
    
      
    
    
      It's - really makes it a lot nicer to transcribe because
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      there  can  be a lot of heated discussions about these very technical issues and people  will  have their opinions and, you know -
    
    
       Mm-hmm.
    
    
      And then you can - It's really nice to have a little bit of humor, a little bit of
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      break away from that because it's hard to sit there and li- see - like,
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      "But, don't you see h- you're being rude to this person, you're cutting off this person and it's not nice?" 
    
    
      I know.  
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      I started like kind of making mental friends. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Uh-huh. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      I'm just like,  "I really like that person. You know what, I'm gonna be his or her friend." 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      And then -  
    
    
      I agree with you. I agree, it's - it's really interesting, Also, i- it's a persona, you get this -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Yeah. You definitely get an image of -
    
    
       there's  definitely a sense of persona. 
    
    
      
    
    
      uh -  Especially  if you can relate it to what the person - or y- what you  assume  the person is
    
    
       uh  interested in academically. 
    
    
       @@ 
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      It's really -
    
    
      Some of that computer stuff, I just - Oh, my God.
    
    
      
    
    
      I'll just sit there like going, "Oh fff!"   It's going right over my head. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, I just - I start zoning out sometimes. Like, I don't  mean  to, but I'm just kind of going, "I don't know what  any  of these acronyms are and  no  idea what you're talking about."
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      And there was a whole set of  meetings  that are like that. It - Wasn't there? Yeah, those were really hard.
    
    
      That's right.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh, yeah.
    
    
      Really hard.
    
    
      And they're writing stuff on boards and stuff that we can't  see,  and so we don't know what they're  referring  to, and so.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, and it's hard -
    
    
      
    
    
      Right. Yeah, all you hear is the squeaky pen, and you're like, "Oh, no, something -
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Right.  
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      something's going on that I don't know."
    
    
      Yeah, they're referring to this or that and the other thing and you're just going, "No,  I don't understand."
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
       U- no .
    
    
      Yeah, you guys  talked  about doing a  videotape. 
    
    
      Yeah, it's difficult.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yes.   um,  it's mainly a matter of -
    
    
      The-
    
    
      sort of -
    
    
      
    
    
       two  things. First is the storage. It'd be so huge that, uh, you'd wanna be sure that it was of interest to someone, that it would be worthwhile doing.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      And that's the other thing, that we don't have
    
    
      someone currently doing the video thing. It would really be interesting.
    
    
        
    
    
      Yeah. Cuz I know it was  mentioned. 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Also having a meeting where you all wore blindfolds.
    
    
       Yeah.
    
    
      Oh? 
    
    
       That was Liz's idea. 
    
    
      Li- it was Liz's idea, wasn't it?
    
    
      Really? 
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      What would be the point of that?
    
    
      Oh, well, it's a question of feedback, and being able to
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      give feedback.
    
    
      Oh, wow.
    
    
      I think that would be really interesting.
    
    
      Oh I see. So you have to do it vocally as opposed to visually? Like you can't use gesture?
    
    
      That  would  be interesting.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Exactly.
    
    
      Oh. 
    
    
      Ah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       Wow.  
    
    
      And, you know - I mean, th- that was the meeting where,  um,  
    
    
      you know the m- the - th- y- y-
    
    
       Partitions wouldn't work. Another possibility is pa- partitions wouldn't work because then it would cut off the P_Z_Ms from  having   the indirect - so it's like you have these unusual configuration problems that -
    
    
      
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      that you wouldn't normally have.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, blindfolds. You know, and someone else said, "Well, maybe you could just turn the light out." 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       There you go. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      That'd be kinda creepy.
    
    
      But then, someone else said no, cuz there are these m- special lights that have to stay on all the time
    
    
      Cute. 
    
    
      Oh. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh. 
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      
    
    
      for the fire code or whatever it is.
    
    
      Oh, wow.
    
    
      Oh. 
    
    
      But then - 
    
    
      I would just be so worried that someone would cheat.
    
    
      
    
    
      You know, it's sort of like a prisoners' di- prisoners' dilemnas game, where  you know, everyone's wearing their blindfold but someone could just cheat and look, see what's -  see what's going on. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       That's right.  
    
    
      
    
    
      Are you raising your hand? 
    
    
      
    
    
       Yeah.  
    
    
      Totally.
    
    
      You know, someone just leaves, you know,  gets coffee, comes back,  and no one knows. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       Right. Right, right.  
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Gets bored. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, I mean, there are other things we could expand on  and  - with - i- in terms of the methodology. It's nice to have a core set of data though and they've d- actually done some -
    
    
      
    
    
      they've had some good results in terms of the digits which
    
    
      they do in terms of having a r- a nice
    
    
      broad set of speakers doing the same thing, meeting after meeting after meeting.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      So, um -
    
    
      That's good.
    
    
      
    
    
      I'm wondering, um, so we still technically -
    
    
       uh  - you know - I mean, what should we do in terms of tea? Technically -
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      if we could hang on for fifteen more minutes and have tea?
    
    
      
    
    
      That's O_K.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      And then continue with this - this next - next week?
    
    
      Yeah, sure.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Oh, yeah.
    
    
      It's O_K.
    
    
      That'd be great.
    
    
      O_K, so, um,  let's see.
    
    
       I had something that I could bring up.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      Um,
    
    
      as far as ideas about
    
    
      looking at the data and getting ideas about
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      
    
    
      whatever you said - hypotheses about how to figure it out.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      One thing that I - I'm - you probably don't remember this - that I was really interested in is the use of "so" and the use of "or".
    
    
      Because the way people use it in these meetings, I found, was - I don't know if it was -
    
    
      
    
    
      it - if it's  different  than other people.  I don't know if it's a  computer  speech thing. 
    
    
      I mean, computer people speech thing, but um,
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      people tend to end utterances quite often with "so" or "or" and trailing off.
    
    
      Oh, yes.
    
    
      M- Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      A couple people in particular do that, yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, mm-hmm. And I found that really interesting, and I was curious to - to figure out when that happened, if it happened in certain occasions  and  whatever, and I never really got around to it, but.
    
    
      Mm-hmm, that's right.
    
    
      
    
    
      Do you people - I mean, does everyone agree with that intu- I mean, I f- I s- share her intuition that's it's - it is sort of  unusual  to have "so" used as a  final, 
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      Oh, yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      uh,
    
    
      
    
    
      part of a person's turn. I mean, it's -
    
    
      It didn't sound stran- I mean, it doesn't sound like bizarre enough that I don't understand.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      But I don't think it's something that happens in just everyday speech really.
    
    
      I don't - no, I don't agree necessarily.  I  do it.
    
    
      I don't -
    
    
      Really?
    
    
      I was wondering.
    
    
      Really?
    
    
      Yeah, I trail off with "so".
    
    
      Huh.
    
    
      Um, I  don't   necessarily do it as often as the one speaker I'm thinking of,  um,
    
    
      but, I  do  do that because -
    
    
      I  think   partly  because I want to make sure that people know that my -
    
    
      my thought - my utterance is finished, 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      but that it's not necessarily final. 
    
    
      Like that you're flexible?
    
    
      Like, you can -
    
    
      Right. Or you can build on it or j- d-
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      I think it's sort of a like - you guys can take from here, you know, somebody - somebody build on my thought. It's - are you - people also do it with "but".
    
    
      expound on it.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      It's kinda like a shrug.
    
    
      Yeah, but it tends to happen - I mean, "so" tends to happen when the person brings up a new idea that kind of goes against what the other people is saying. Or at least that's what I found.
    
    
      It's like a m- it's like a -
    
    
      You know?
    
    
      so. 
    
    
      
    
    
      What do you mean?
    
    
      Like if someone in a meeting is talking about a certain thing and someone kind of interrupts or doesn't necessarily interrupt and says something - either a new topic or a different take on the same topic
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh oh oh, yeah, O_K. 
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
       Uh like -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      will tend to use - will trail off with "so".
    
    
      "So, you can see you might be wrong, but I don't want to actually  say  that." Mm-hmm. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Yes, that's possible, yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, kind of, yeah, yeah.
    
    
      Huh.
    
    
      Yeah, interesting.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      And "or" tends to be used with questions more than -
    
    
      
    
    
        
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      So.
    
    
      That's true.
    
    
      But.
    
    
      I thought that was really interesting.
    
    
      Or y- I've heard you say "so", in that sort of sense like uh, um,
    
    
      "So in other words blah-blah-blah-blah."
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Like a sort of an inad- uh, eh -
    
    
      Of course b- but that's not really an example of this, because they don't just say "so".
    
    
      Right, but -
    
    
      u- Nnn.
    
    
      That's true.
    
    
      Is that right? I mean, s- I just wanna be sure.
    
    
      Ending with "so".
    
    
      Or I - maybe I'm misunderstanding what you were sa-
    
    
      When you  end  with "so".
    
    
      When you end the utterance.
    
    
      When - Oh, just - just ending with "so". O_K.
    
    
      When you say something -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Right, and you say "so".
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, "I c- I could get all those extra signatures, but I don't know, so."
    
    
      It -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       Yeah, to me it's like a vocal shrug.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      It's -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      That's a very nice characterization.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Interesting.
    
    
      S- sort of. 
    
    
      I'd definitely like to look more at that if I can, but.
    
    
      That's cool. 
    
    
      Hm-hmm. 
    
    
      I think people end in "but" a lot too. And I feel that that means that they want somebody else to take it up?  Or somebody just sort of like -
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Oh, yeah.
    
    
      you know, take it from here? So, you know, "Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, but."
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      "But I'm not really sure so you can - you could finish my thought."
    
    
       Once  again a sh- is it a shrug? Would you say  it's another shrug? Or -
    
    
      Yeah, so s-
    
    
      
    
    
      Um,
    
    
      It's a different kind of shrug though.
    
    
      I feel like it - I feel like it sort of, um, asks for somebody else to, uh, put input in now. 
    
    
       O_K.   
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      I could see that.
    
    
      I think it shows less of confident - like less confidence in what they just said in a way.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
       O_K.  
    
    
      Or giving permission?
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Same with "I don't know".
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      You can also end an  utterance   with,
    
    
      
    
    
      uh, "blah-blah-blah but I don't know".
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Like that.
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Like, I feel like maybe that's similar to "but".
    
    
      Yeah. More similar than to "so" I think.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah, that's interesting.
    
    
      To "so", yeah. I think so too.
    
    
      Huh.
    
    
      Huh, interesting.
    
    
      
    
    
      What about, um, the way people treat
    
    
      w- when they give a joke, I mean, and - and they're like -
    
    
      they laugh and then after the laugh they say, "uh".
    
    
      I mean, if you - so it's like, "ha-ha-ha  uh".
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      I mean - 
    
    
      Do you - Have you run across this?
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
       
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      And it's like, to  me  - I - I think I've heard  comedians  do that. There's some- there's something there about -
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       
    
    
      you know, you - you make a joke and then you have an "uh" in there somehow,
    
    
      which I don't really understand the function of. Do  you  -
    
    
      Maybe it's like saying like,
    
    
      "This is funny but maybe it shouldn't be funny"  or "This is funny but maybe it's funny for some sort of perverse reason". 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Or maybe it's just a link to get back to the conversation or something?  Like to connect it with what is going on
    
    
      
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Well, eh how - O_K, so the one I'm thinking of is like if
    
    
      elsewhere? 
    
    
      like "ha-ha"  uh, you say - you would say like, um,
    
    
       uh like - O_K, so he's laughing "ha-ha" and then he'd go "i- uh". 
    
    
      Oh, like kind of -
    
    
      And -
    
    
      kind of laughing with it in a way? Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Kinda, yeah, kinda like "Uh." You know.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      And to  me  that's more of like the  "Maybe this shouldn't be funny but it is. Maybe this is funny because it's kind of disgusting or perverse in some way."
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Huh. Yeah.
    
    
      It's possible, now what I'm thinking - I didn't have the extra - the extra
    
    
      e- um, what do you say, nuances in the "uh", which you just - which you just did. However, the context fits. I mean, that's an interesting take on it. I think -
    
    
      Wi -
    
    
      Oh, O_K.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      It's possible.
    
    
      It's possible.
    
    
      So you meant just sort of like a - just a normal "uh"?
    
    
      
    
    
      It's just a normal "uh". Mm-hmm.
    
    
       Yeah .
    
    
      But it's stuck in - maybe it's a little louder than usual. It's not any of the extra,
    
    
      um,
    
    
      you know, glottal thing.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Meaning, "Let's keep going"?
    
    
       Maybe  it means that.
    
    
      Well,
    
    
      
    
    
      but it just seems like it's more  prominent  than - You know it really is like a
    
    
      Uh.
    
    
       placeholder  of  some  sort, like -
    
    
      which I think is self- reflexive  in - in the - sort of brings focus back onto the  jokemaker, 
    
    
      That's - yeah.
    
    
      Maybe if - maybe it's when people don't laugh enough or something.
    
    
      but -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, that's possible. O_K.
    
    
      I don't know.
    
    
      Yeah, like, "Let's come back to the original subject and I will take it from there".
    
    
      
    
    
       Oh.  It could  be. 
    
    
      Yes, po- that's possible.
    
    
      Maybe.
    
    
      It's possible. 
    
    
      Cuz I've heard, um,  Morgan  do that.
    
    
      
    
    
      Exactly who I was thinking of actually.  Uh-huh.  Yeah. Exactly. Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, he does that a  lot. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      For obvious reasons, probably, if that's the way he uses it.
    
    
      That's true, that would - The - And he does  continue  after that. But it's just - you know, to say "uh" - you kn- to say "uh" while you're  laughing 
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      i- it's just to me it's an interesting category.
    
    
      I think it may almost have to do with like,
    
    
      "O_K, I told a joke, now everyone's laughing, and now it's common courtesy I'll  sort-of  
    
    
      
    
    
      tell everyone to  stop  laughing, you know, so you don't offend me about
    
    
      
    
    
      how good my joke was." You know, it's almost like, "O_K,
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      uh, O_K, my joke's over, you know, you can stop laughing now".
    
    
      
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      That's possible.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Giving them permission to -
    
    
      Yeah. You know, because it's like -
    
    
       I don't know about permission.
    
    
      Hmm!
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      How do you - you know, how much do you laugh after someone's joke to
    
    
      Yeah, yeah, yeah.
    
    
      tell them how much you enjoyed it or -
    
    
      Be polite, or whatever. 
    
    
       Yeah. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Or how long do you wait after the joke
    
    
       To keep going with the meeting.  Yeah.
    
    
      to - Right.
    
    
      Very  interesting.   Interesting. 
    
    
      Cuz sometimes you can get on digressions that just last for like minutes at a time.
    
    
      Right. 
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      And people are just hysterical and they're like, "What were we talking about? I don't know". 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, that's - that's -  Huh,  O_K.
    
    
      
    
    
      It's hard when people get really really in- like into their laughing and start talking at the same time.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      It's hard to figure out what they're doi- what they're talking about, and also they don't tend to talk very f- there's a lot of disfluencies when they're laughing and talking.
    
    
         Yeah.
    
    
       Definitely. 
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      It's hard to -
    
    
      
    
    
      Sometimes they make  me  laugh  so  hard, because they'll just be talking  about something technical and I'll be so bored and then suddenly they'll say something
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      that  they  only just sort of  chuckle  at  and then I laugh at for the next like  twenty  minutes 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      because I think it's so funny. 
    
    
      Like one time  everybody was doing the, um, digits, and they were all doing it at the same time, and they started off kind of shaky, they were like, "Oh, do we wanna do this at the same time, you know, that's -   - you know, wh- let's not all start laughing" and then they all did it at the same time and
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh, right.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      one person ended up at the very end doing the digits and everybody had  finished  and he had like two more lines to go, and when he ended somebody turned to him and went, "You lose!"  
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Go - 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       Oh n-  
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      And I just kept laughing and laughing and laughing.  
    
    
      
    
    
      Johno keeps making comments about the transcribers.
    
    
      
    
    
       Yes.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      It's the funniest thing. He - he'll like say - he'll say like mean things about the transcribers. He'll be like - 
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      What does he say?
    
    
      He's very funny.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       Why? 
    
    
      
    
    
      "Oh, but I don't mean the transcribers we have  here  of course."
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh.  
    
    
      Like - Well  sometimes  he'll do that, yeah. But sometimes he doesn't. And sometimes he'll just be like uh,
    
    
      you know, um, " Here,  Transcribers,  try  transcribing  this! "
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, like when they do random sounds that you have no idea -
    
    
      Like, "Thanks!"  
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      He's very funny.
    
    
      Right.  
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      I - I started laughing with something he said the other day, it was - it was the beginning of a meeting and it hadn't gotten far into it and -
    
    
      and he's - he's doing this - one of these mock fights with Nancy, which he does. Have you run across these mock fights? 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      And he s- he says,  um, something like,
    
    
      
    
    
      uh,
    
    
      I - i- and he's m- e- they - they have this nice
    
    
        mutual condescending joking thing going on, and he says,
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      "Well, I could explain this to you. I have a better  laugh  than you do. The transcribers  told  me so." 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      And it went on a little longer but it's li- it's like this really - 
    
    
      Li- 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, and then at  one  point she - you know, at another meeting, she - she was not sure which channel she was on, and he said, "Well, I think you're on channel so-and-so" and then she said, "Well, no, sh- shouldn't it be channel so-and-so?" and
    
    
      
    
    
      he says "Well, no, it should be channel so-and-so". And then it turned out it  was  channel so-and-so which he said, and - and she said - he s- he said,
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      "I bested you again Nancy".  And she said, "Yes, that's my recollection of all of our meetings together". 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       Oh, no.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh my God.  
    
    
      They have this really nice - You know, it's really - Those sorts of things, i- it's true, you know, it's like, it really does liven things up to have the, uh,
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
       the nice interrelationships. I think -
    
    
      
    
    
      I - I found that's a nice aspect of a  lot  of these meetings, the -
    
    
      eh the, uh,
    
    
      eh little
    
    
      
    
    
      periods of humor like that.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Alright, well, so do we - would - would - we could do  digits  if we so  desired.  If w- if we  wanted  to  do  that.
    
    
      Woo-hoo! 
    
    
      
    
    
      Ah, the digits task. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Let's do simultaneous digits. No, let's - let's not.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Let's do simultaneous digits.
    
    
      We -
    
    
      
    
    
      can somebody explain to me  why  you do  digits?  I still don't really know.
    
    
      No, no, let's not. 
    
    
      No, you don't?
    
    
      
    
    
      O_K, the idea is that you have -
    
    
      then, um, you have ground truth, you know exactly what they're  supposed  to have said, and then of course sometimes we go through and actually, um, people do double check that they read them correctly and all, 
    
    
      
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      so that we're sure, as you've done.
    
    
      
    
    
      I remember I  did  that a  little  bit, and, yeah, you must have  too. 
    
    
      Yeah, I did that once too.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, yeah.
    
    
      And you  did also?
    
    
      
    
    
      We - we are meant to be transcribing if they're just left in the - the curly brackets?
    
    
      Kinda early on.
    
    
      
    
    
      No, because it's - it's -
    
    
      
    
    
      it should be able to be taken care of efficiently with this interface.
    
    
      I mean, if the T- Tigerfish people  do  it, then,
    
    
      Yeah, they  do  write the numbers in. Yeah.
    
    
      you know, leave it, that's fine. Yeah.
    
    
      The - Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, I've been just leaving it.
    
    
      And  sometimes  they  don't. 
    
    
      Oh, I've been writing the numbers just cuz I wasn't sure what to do.
    
    
      Sometimes they don't.
    
    
      Well, if you do that's - that's alright as well.
    
    
      Oh, really?
    
    
      You don't have to?
    
    
      You don't have to.
    
    
      Oh, O_K.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Because, uh, we're - we have the assumption that we'll take care of it this - in this other
    
    
      way, but
    
    
      
    
    
      In any case, the idea is that you have ground truth, you know exactly what the person should have said and you check to be sure, and usually there aren't many errors - eh w- when they  were  checked.
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      Um, and then, you have this multiplicity of voices,
    
    
      uh, reading these things, and you can do really good speech recognition that way.
    
    
      So they have some papers out that they've done this. It's really -
    
    
      it's been very fruitful in terms of the analyses. It's nice to have,
    
    
      Huh.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      you know, a standard - Uh, you know, it's like,
    
    
      uh, psychological approach also that  you like to have some standard stimulus here and then you can - Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Oh, yeah. No, I totally agree.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      I - I agree, I think it's a nice - it's a nice design feature.
    
    
      
    
    
      Where's the little things that's supposed to say "transcript L_ dash blah-blah-blah"?
    
    
      Oh, it's at the top.
    
    
       Yes, you run across that.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Let's see, I guess it would be - it's up there.
    
    
      It's right here, yeah. I looked for that too.
    
    
      Oh, I see.
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      Up there  at  the top.
    
    
      Ah. Oh. O_K.
    
    
      
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      
    
    
      So,  I  have a question.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Cuz now I'm looking at this
    
    
      and I realize I don't know the answer,  is, um,
    
    
      sometimes when people are reading
    
    
      "zero",  they say "O_", and sometimes they say "zero", but - And  I  thought
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      that there must be an indication  here. 
    
    
       Used  to  be. 
    
    
      That's what I thought too.
    
    
       Used  to  be. 
    
    
      Oh, that - "read O_ or read zero".
    
    
       Hmm. 
    
    
      Oh. 
    
    
      This - they changed  them.   Initially it was  words  all spelled out, so "O_N_E" -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
       Oh. 
    
    
      Mmm. 
    
    
      Oh, my!
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
       Oh,  wow.
    
    
       Yeah. 
    
    
      
    
    
      And that was like a  Stroop  test in  some  ways. It took a lot of conc- When I was doing  those  I had to really  concentrate.  It was like s- "One, s- seven" - you know, it was like - You really had to - "let's see, the words and the numbers" and -
    
    
       Yeah. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, you're not used to seeing the  numbers  like that.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      and then you'd have an "O_H" periodically and, um, they were initially spelled out that way, one or the other.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Huh.
    
    
       I  see, so  that's  why.
    
    
      But we converted  them   to  this  format, and then the idea - I mean, you could conceivably put an "O_H" or a "zero" for the "O_'s" and still have this benefit, but I think that the idea is that people can choose what they think is most natural for them to say in those - those locations, and - you know, maybe there'd be -
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      So it's optional. You can say one or the other?
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yes, mm-hmm.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      So, um -
    
    
       Oh, can I ask also? Um, it says - it looks like the groupings are important, but some of the transcripts I've seen they don't have any commas or breaks, it's just a string of numbers. So we should be adding the breaks if -
    
    
      Sure.
    
    
      
    
    
        
    
    
      Yes. Well, see - er -  also,   this  has been a - a change in the procedure that -  used  to be that they  were  like uh one long string -
    
    
      Oh, O_K.
    
    
      different sized strings. But to have  them   broken up like this, it's - it's m- been about
    
    
      
    
    
      uh maybe half a year that - that this -
    
    
      or maybe - maybe seven months, I don't know,
    
    
      maybe longer,  that they've gotten actually broken up within the line.
    
    
        
    
    
      
    
    
      Mmm.
    
    
      So the idea is   to pause when you see that.
    
    
      But in the transcriptions - I mean, we don't have to deal with that because when
    
    
      No.
    
    
      the other interface deals with it then they break it up or whatever.
    
    
      That's right, break it up more finely.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      But if you can clearly hear pauses and  there've  not been transcribed, we should be adding the commas or not?
    
    
      Though the one I'm working on now is like that.
    
    
      Well -
    
    
      I would say don't worry about that, because, um,
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
       this is w- again - you know, it - it'd be nice to get the words right,
    
    
      but, um,
    
    
      the -
    
    
      uh, the interface that  these  guys used, uh, allows you to set the time boundaries really accurately, so it's not so important. It's more important to focus on the words, because there we don't know the ground truth.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      So.
    
    
      O_K, so -
    
    
      Are we gonna do  them    together  then? Or no?
    
    
      Well, I don't know, how do you feel? I mean, what we could do is we could do it together one week and then separate the next or something like that to give the variety.
    
    
      Yeah, I don't care. Whatever.
    
    
      Sure.
    
    
      Sure.
    
    
      Whatever.
    
    
      We -
    
    
       Sure.
    
    
      why don't we do  them   together this time just because - in the interest of time, to get you out in time.
    
    
      
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
       O_K.  
    
    
       O_K.  
    
    
      O_K, so, um,
    
    
       we just start out, we - and you s- you say, "transcript L_" whatever it is, and then launch into the numbers and then pause between the gr- the gaps and then - I guess you're  supposed  to treat -
    
    
      
    
    
      Sure.
    
    
      Pause after each  line? 
    
    
      Yeah, you s- well, you're supposed to treat each line as kind of like a little sentence.
    
    
      What do they say, "Each  line 
    
    
       O_K.  
    
    
       into  smaller groups. Please read each string as if you were giving it to someone over the telephone using the groupings indicated. Think of the groupings as similar to groupings in telephone numbers, social security number." 
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Uh-huh.
    
    
      Pause briefly between lines.
    
    
      Yes, there you go.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      O_K. So, here we go.
    
    
       O_K.  
    
    
      Alright.

       And  I  only  started  laughing  when I had  one  batch of numbers  left,  and I  couldn't   get  it. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh no. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Aw!
    
    
       I'm  just happy I didn't make any  mistakes.  
    
    
      He - You almost made me mess up. 
    
    
      I had to plug my ears. I couldn't listen to everybody else. 
    
    
        Um. 
    
    
      
    
    
      It was  hard! 
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh yeah? That's why I - that's why I sat back here, I was like, "I didn't want - I - I don't wanna look at you people."  To read it. 
    
    
      I- it just c- 
    
    
      
    
    
       That's right. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      It's - it's funny how distracting it is, you know? It's like  there's  no content.
    
    
      
    
    
      It  is. 
    
    
      It is, it's hard.
    
    
      It  is. 
    
    
      Ye- he almost made me mess up. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Did y- did you finish your last batch? O_K. 
    
    
      I finished my last one, it was really hard though.
    
    
      
    
    
      O_K, good.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       You're  right in the  middle  of it, yeah.  I'm  on the  edge.  
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      Yeah. I mean, I got all the way down and then the very last one came and I was like, "I haven't laughed."  And then I was . And then I just couldn't help it. 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       You did?  
    
    
       Oh, no.
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh, that's the killer.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      O_K, well, I wanna thank you very much, and um, look f- and so we'll meet next week at the same time, u- unless - I mean, I g- I need to check on the schedule but I think, um,

      Yeah, well, I  think  so. Yeah, I mean, if you  want  to. Yeah, so Tigerfish  does  a first pass, I mean it -
    
    
       to  transcribe? Oh, yeah? Oh, O_K.
    
    
      
    
    
      I was just curious.
    
    
      And then we get to check  it  through it.
    
    
      I don't want people to - I mean, so -
    
    
      I think it'll be  interesting. 
    
    
      Yeah, I'd  like  to.
    
    
      Oh, yeah. Oh, totally, I wanna hear it, actually.
    
    
      I think it's terrific.
    
    
      Yeah, me too.
    
    
      Yeah, well O_K,  @@  -
    
    
      Well, we  have  to l- hear it because we're gonna get to - we have to get to look at our  version   or  whatever.
    
    
      That's right, you get the participant
    
    
      Approve it or whatever.
    
    
      With correction. That's right.
    
    
      Oh, good. Oh,  that's  right.
    
    
      You're gonna go through the whole procedure. You get to see the - the web interface and you listen to things, and - Yeah.

      Yeah.

      Yes.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      So I'll - I guess I'll keep the agenda.
    
    
      That's what I was just gonna say.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, and you know - this is - I - I put this - I sort of went - I had two versions of this and I blended  them   together so it's not as -
    
    
      Oh. O_K.
    
    
      Oh, yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      It's not as tight as I might have liked it but I just wanted to throw out as many ideas as I - as I could.
    
    
       No , it's great.
    
    
      I'll just try  and   be extra aware during the next week and like  note some things down .
    
    
      
    
    
      O_K, that's fine.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah. If you happen to think of some particular s- startling  changes  that you came across.  I've run across - I'm gonna - I think maybe I'll bring in some examples that  I've  run across that were surprising.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      The  Tigerfish  people, cuz they don't have as much  experience, 
    
    
       Mm-hmm.
    
    
      sometimes come up with some  really   surprising  things.
    
    
      There was one that was  nowhere   close  to what it  really   was  because the word involved "granularity". Well, you know. I don't know how often -
    
    
      
    
    
      They were putting it in terms that had to do with  finance.  You know, I don't know how long they run into - how often they run into " granularity ".
    
    
      Granularity? 
    
    
      
    
    
      Hmm, mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah, right.
    
    
      And, like,  statistical  things. Like um,
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      like - we have all taken  stats,  I'm assuming. So, you know -
    
    
      No. 
    
    
      No. 
    
    
      Oh! So they'll say things like "correlation coefficient" and they won't trans- they - they won't be able to transcribe that.
    
    
      
    
    
      Nnn-mm. 
    
    
      Nope.
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh, I see.
    
    
      Oh, they won't know what the word is? Oh, that's interesting.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Oh, interesting.
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      Um,
    
    
      .
    
    
      you know, just things like that.
    
    
      
    
    
      "Reliability analysis", that's kinda easy though, that's just - you spell it out, but.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Whatever.
    
    
      Yeah, I've run across things that - it's just clearly  that  -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh, "collinearity"!
    
    
      Oh, interesting.
    
    
      Colline- collinearity. That's a statistical term.
    
    
      What?
    
    
      Collinearity.
    
    
      Oh, how was  that  one done? Interesting.
    
    
      Whew. 
    
    
      Yeah, they just - euh! 
    
    
      
    
    
      Really?
    
    
      Yeah, O_K,  @@ 
    
    
      See, if I can hear it clearly enough, then I don't have a problem with it.
    
    
      Yeah, then you'd know the word.
    
    
      Yeah, .
    
    
      Yeah, but like -
    
    
      You have to know that's it's spelled with two L_'s though. It's one word, it's collinear- it's not "co" hyphen "linearity". It's "collinearity".
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      Oh.  Oh.
    
    
       I  wouldn't know how to spell it.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       I  wouldn't know that  either. 
    
    
       I  wouldn't have known that.
    
    
      Well, whatever.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
       Now  I  do! 
    
    
      
    
    
      And so if you come across that word -

      O_K.
    
    
      You know, I found the mikes a little unnerving for the first half of the meeting.

      Yeah.
    
    
      I got nervous a little.
    
    
      I just tried not to worry about it.
    
    
       
    
    
      Yeah, I would start saying something and then feel very like out in the open, like "Wow, everybody's listening to me."
