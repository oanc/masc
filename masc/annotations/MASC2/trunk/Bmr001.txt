      O_K.
    
    
      Are we live or are we Memorex?
    
    
      We're
    
    
      O_K, so that's
    
    
      
    
    
      somewhere in between. O_K, so we have some sheets for uh  some
    
    
      Wait.
    
    
      Right. So.
    
    
      standard doohickies to -
    
    
      You're going to sit  there? 
    
    
      Is that alright?
    
    
      Yeah, O_K, maybe I'll put this thing  here  then.
    
    
      O_K. 
    
    
      O_K, so this is February second, eh, two thousand, this is eh
    
    
      meeting number one  with Adam and Dan and Morgan, about five o'clock
    
    
      uh in the afternoon.
    
    
      A range of microphones.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      What's this one here? This - this one is - has a couple of cheezy  electrettes  and -
    
    
      Yeah, that's -  that's the dummy - dummy P_D_A.
    
    
      That's connected too, or - ? 
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      Yeah, it  is. 
    
    
      That's connected.
    
    
      It's got two - to both channels.
    
    
      Yeah, both channels.
    
    
      Oh, hang on.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, it is at the  moment. 
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      This is -
    
    
      Although the gain  is pretty low.
    
    
      So for the um  read numbers task,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Hang on, let's - let's -
    
    
      I have extracted these -
    
    
      O_K let's just - let's just name the microphones.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      So I'm speaking on the  ear mounted  uh wired headset thing.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Right and I'm now talking on microphone number two,
    
    
      uh, the  wireless  microphone number two.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Um, I have no idea which one I'm - I'm on. Oh one! Oh, I'm number one.
    
    
      I'm -
    
    
      You're on one.
    
    
      Absolutely.
    
    
      O_K,  which is a - a l- a lapel, in fact it's sticking through my  lapel.
    
    
      Yes.
    
    
      O_K so this is - this is the P_Z_M nearest the eh
    
    
      eh the  machine  room end of the table.
    
    
      Actually, i-
    
    
      Then  there's - I  know,  but yeah.  It's number three, it says, but  we'll be able to figure it out. This is at the middle of the table
    
    
      This further down the table.
    
    
      And this - this one is right at the end of the table, O_K?
    
    
      And then we've got the uh -
    
    
      This is the  left  side of the dummy P_D_A and
    
    
      this would be the right side.
    
    
      I think listening to this is gonna be like watching somebody's home movies. 
    
    
      
    
    
      Yes, it'll be pretty horrible.
    
    
      Yeah, O_K.
    
    
      Very exciting.
    
    
      So, what I have on these forms here is for the read numbers - read digits tasks and it's extracted directly from Aurora  and uh -
    
    
      So what I was thinking is we could start just by filling it out and then reading - reading the numbers on the form.
    
    
      O_K, what do we do with the stuff on top?
    
    
      Fill it out.
    
    
      But I -
    
    
      Do we say it after we -
    
    
      No. Just write it down. 
    
    
      No, you don't need to.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      What are we - why are we writing it down?
    
    
      So that  when we  transcribe the data we can figure out who said it and their gender and the date and the time and what mike they were on and all that sort of thing.
    
    
      Oh.
    
    
      O_K
    
    
      That's good. So I don't need to fill that out right now. So maybe we should just say it.
    
    
      W-
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Why don't you want to fill it out right now? Just so that -
    
    
      So then we're not spending the time writing it out. So that we're spending the time talking.
    
    
      Well, how about  you give me one of those and we can fill it out and  Morgan  can read and then we can do it like  that. 
    
    
      I'm just uh concerned about a bunch of dead time while we all sit here and fill out the things.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Yeah, yeah, yeah.
    
    
      Right?
    
    
      
    
    
      And so you have to be sure to pause  between each line, since we're going to be segmenting it and then  doing it that way.
    
    
       Oh. 
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      O_K, so this is Morgan. I'm going to read some numbers now.
    
    
      one 
    
    
      two 
    
    
      three zero eight two 
    
    
      five two one zero nine 
    
    
      six three 
    
    
      seven five 
    
    
      eight six zero one one six two 
    
    
      nine 
    
    
      O_ O_ two O_ six - 
    
    
      Whoops  that's a mistake, disfluency, scratch, start over. 
    
    
      O_ O_ two one six four one 
    
    
      zero zero seven zero four 
    
    
      That's  my  group.
    
    
      O_K. So, Adam Janin next,  uh transcript number two on a wireless headset number two. 
    
    
      two seven O_ 
    
    
      three six seven 
    
    
      four 
    
    
      five 
    
    
      seven one nine zero 
    
    
      eight five 
    
    
      nine eight zero seven four three seven 
    
    
      O_ 
    
    
      zero nine nine five 
    
    
      one 
    
    
      O_K. This is Dan on the uh wired headset, transcript number one. 
    
    
      two one four eight 
    
    
      three eight eight 
    
    
      four three O_ six five seven one 
    
    
      five five two seven 
    
    
      six 
    
    
      seven 
    
    
      eight 
    
    
      O_ three O_ 
    
    
      zero two 
    
    
      one five one eight 
    
    
      So I definitely wasn't pausing enough between them. 
    
    
      This is - these are things we will find out.
    
    
      That'll be an issue.
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      Yeah.  I don't know if I said mine was transcript zero, but it  was. 
    
    
      Mm-hmm!
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh, good.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      That's a little bit.
    
    
      Can I
    
    
      So, so where are we in this? Let's see, so we now - we now have a few mikes that work. How long did it take you to set this up?
    
    
      have something to write on the back of?
    
    
      Thanks.
    
    
      Oh! It didn't - doesn't take - Well, I mean as you  see  we haven't really set it up that  well,  but it doesn't - it doesn't take long to set up. I mean,
    
    
      We just came up here  one night after  recording  so it took like twenty minutes something like that.
    
    
      Right and that - that included a fair amount of fiddling around,
    
    
      I mean it's -
    
    
      Yeah,  I mean the  equipment  -
    
    
      since it's - it's more or less the first time we've tried to do it.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      The equip- Me and Adam went through it yesterday, just looked at everything. But it's all kind of  here  and set up, so it's just a question of turning it all  on. 
    
    
      And, um -
    
    
      I mean, ev- eventually we'll want to like
    
    
      running the program.
    
    
      tape that over and run them up through the center so that wires aren't - aren't - people aren't tripping over the wires and so on.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Are we gonna - I mean, is it gonna be over there, or is it gonna be in there?
    
    
      Um, it's - it's gonna b- it's - for reasons - because of the microphones runs we want that chunk  there.  There's more equipment in  there. 
    
    
      But there's -  the idea is that there are  these microphones on the  table,  there are some  cables  coming down  sort of under a nice  mat,
    
    
      and then that's -  they - a bunch of them get sort of converged  with  digital there.
    
    
      And the idea is that this gets replaced by a cabinet with doors, so that -  so that it's not  open to fiddling.
    
    
      So that's what's gonna happen.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      That's
    
    
      Do we have like a  cabinet on order or do we just need to do that?
    
    
      We need to  do  that. It's on a list of things to do.  I keep on hoping that  they're gonna get done but they don't.
    
    
      
    
    
      Well, I -  I can help them get done um one question is budget. Do we have any money at all that we can go out and spend on things like cabinets or a hard drive or things like that.
    
    
      I -
    
    
      Yeah!
    
    
      Oh - I mean, I don't know. Did we s- did we spend our - the budget already that we had?
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Uh, how much  are we talking about here?
    
    
      Um.
    
    
      I don't know. A cabinet is probably going to cost  a hundred dollars, two hundred dollars something like that.
    
    
      I mean.
    
    
      Yeah, I mean, you know, we - we can spend under a thousand dollars or something without - without worrying about it.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I mean, I think - um  I'm  more  worried about things being kept in a funky state long enough that - that uh stuff gets broken or - or
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      you know.
    
    
      Well, I think our intention at this point is when we're not using it to record a meeting we'll coil them all up and put them under  so that people will not be tripping over them and so on.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      So.
    
    
      But,  well we should get to a - a nice kind of working state of our set up  as quickly as possible.
    
    
      Yeah, and there's also the minor matter, it'd be  kind  of nice to able to  bring people in and say "yes, this is where we do such-and-such",
    
    
      Right. Not have it -
    
    
      and then be able to see uh,
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      you know,
    
    
       some kind of - I mean it's
    
    
      less important than doing what we're doing right now but -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      So.
    
    
      I mean  there's one big issue with the equipment still,
    
    
      which is um
    
    
      ultimately we're gonna - well the idea is to have
    
    
      any number of these wired headsets, but
    
    
      there's this amplification problem.
    
    
      I built this thing, it's - that's - it's very noisy. We're actually recording - I'm -  I'm  going through it at the moment,  but it's so noisy that I am not using for  this. 
    
    
      it's - it's designed to be used for the - for the desktop  meeting  as well.
    
    
      But I'm using - running that through my uh   damp  machine as a pre-amp as an alternative.
    
    
      Well, we  should  be able to just go buy some  preamps,   I would think.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      It's just - it eh
    
    
      You see how clumsy this is right? I have to use these batteries to bias them.
    
    
      And I'm only get two channels and there're a bunch of - 
    
    
      There are like three connectors in the circuit.
    
    
      The thing is, like,
    
    
      it's -
    
    
      it's not s- it's not that the thing doesn't  exist   commercially, but there isn't one unit which does the whole thing in one - in one  swoop.
    
    
      So it seemed like it was a good idea to  make  one.
    
    
       um
    
    
      And I'm  still  not  sure.  I mean, I think  I probably know how to fix this. I can probably
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      build it better so it doesn't have such noise, but
    
    
      it's kind of  a buy .
    
    
      Well, ultimately we're gonna need to build one anyway.
    
    
      Are we?
    
    
      Sure. Because we- we're gonna have to put it in a P_D_A.
    
    
      Well, we  could  just -
    
    
      Well.
    
    
      Right? If we have microphones in a P_D_A it's gonna need
    
    
      bias and  a pre-amp.
    
    
      I guess I'd sort of figured that - that Jim would do that at some  point.  Right?
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Well n-
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Jim is busy at the moment. That's the  problem.  I was kind of hoping that Jim was going to build this box.
    
    
      But um - but he hasn't had time.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       Well , I think - I think he  is  quite interested in doing it. But.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Well
    
    
      If it's  too  noisy and if there's something we can buy, again for, you know,  moderate  amount of price, even if it takes a  couple  boxes or something, maybe we should just do it.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      And then - and then  later  we can  uh replace it with -
    
    
      Because there may be other considerations  that will go into the design. I mean, uh
    
    
      our getting some experience with this may help to determine  some of things that are - I don't know - might change this design,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      So.
    
    
      There was uh a statement made
    
    
      uh
    
    
      which I don't think is  right,  by the way, but - 
    
    
      there was a statement made at the uh DARPA Communicator meeting I was at recently
    
    
      that um
    
    
       
    
    
      microphone - multiple microphones  at a distance of less than  three feet or something like that were  totally  useless,  completely  irrelevant.
    
    
      Oh!
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      You - you mean for noise cancelling, or - ? 
    
    
      for nois- noise cancelling.
    
    
      Um,
    
    
      my counter argument is - is an - uh uh um, a white rat.
    
    
      
    
    
      uh, which  has th- it's two microphones exceedingly close together and it works pretty well. 
    
    
      Oh. 
    
    
      Um but -
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       This   happened .
    
    
      Do they mean  omnidirectional, is that their point? I mean all the noise cancelling mikes, they're - you know, they're a few m- millimeters away from each other pointing in different directions.
    
    
      I think -  uh, I mean, uh my  guess  is that means it's just that if it's - if it's  near  field,  the mathematics of beam -  beam steering is different.
    
    
      But.
    
    
      Oh, I see.
    
    
      If the f- if the wavefronts are  not  approximately  planar   then you can't just do delay and sum and expect it to work.
    
    
      
    
    
       It's  - Oh, O_K, so they're not talking about  how far apart the  mikes  are, they're talking about how far they are from the  speaker. 
    
    
      I  guess.  Yeah.
    
    
      Right. But I think that if - my point is I guess if you - if you have a um -
    
    
      a uh s- a  volume  in between  the two - the two uh uh  sensors 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      and you do something  cleverer, 
    
    
      there clearly are ways  to get more out of it.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, yeah.
    
    
       Yeah.
    
    
      Right, right, right. I mean the - um
    
    
      The - the weird thing is that actually  delay in some beam-forming is not - is not the clever thing to do.  The -
    
    
      the - the underwater guys do this stuff which is  different.
    
    
      And it actually means that you should get the microphones as close together as possible.
    
    
      Rather than trying to get them far apart so you can get  separation, you sort of -  you want them very close. And -
    
    
      And  the math is too difficult for me to understand but it's - but it's there.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      Well, there are various points in meeting where people were making uh uh  very  strong statements as a matter of  fact,  like one shouldn't even question it and 
    
    
      this was one of them that  was kind of  funny.
    
    
      Um but I - I - I - what I take it to mean is doing - doing the dumb thing
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      uh with two microphones would be very difficult to get too much out of it but
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I think it will be  interesting  to do other things that aren't dumb.
    
    
      So I - I still think it's potentially   interesting to do that. Although we- we'll have to be uh a- aware of this if we're writing proposals about it,
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      wherever, that there may well be reviewers who will say, "well everyone  knows  that  you can't get anything out of it if it's -  if it's close".
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Do they believe you can get speaker location out of it? Cuz that's - that's one way we could sneak it in.
    
    
      Uh, that is an interesting point.
    
    
      Yeah. Certainly you can
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Well we could -
    
    
      get some -
    
    
      I mean. By the time -  We'll have - we'll have data so we can actually  you know, demonstrate that.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Well.
    
    
      Hopefully.
    
    
      Oh, you mean for location?
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      O_K. Depends on who's working on it. 
    
    
       Well,  we're getting some -
    
    
      we- we're getting some right  now. 
    
    
      Yeah, right.
    
    
      
    
    
       but someone has to write some software to - to actually do it. Someone might.
    
    
      Right. Right. But I mean.
    
    
      Well someone- someone might be interested in - in it.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Oh that's uh - I was just thinking one thing we may wanna do is put the fake P_D_A right in front of someone 
    
    
      instead of in the middle of the table like we have it now.
    
    
      on the thought that - my vision of it is you know each of us will have our little P_D_A in front of us  and so the acoustics - uh you might want to try to match the acoustics.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       Maybe. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      But on the other hand, 
    
    
      suppose that uh, you're the only one uh who is  advanced  enough in this  thinking  to actually  bring  such a P_D_A to - to a  meeting 
    
    
      No, and I don't need to meet with  those  people. 
    
    
      and - and - 
    
    
      
    
    
      and therefore  you  bring it  in,   and you probably want it to be as  near  to people as  possible  so you might in fact  shove  it to the middle of the  table. 
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Well. 
    
    
      Yep, yep.  For those those we can make several - several more of these 
    
    
      and then we can have actual  recording with you know three  P_D_As.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Well, I  think  we  should. 
    
    
      I mean, I think at  least  with  two.   Right?
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Because uh one of the th- one of the fantasies that was at least fun to  talk  about was that uh
    
    
      uh O_K maybe you th- 
    
    
      you're - 
    
    
      the range of things you can do with multiple microphones is limited if they're a few inches apart,
    
    
       but  what if you have  two  of these things?
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      And you know we have this - this idea of the handshake  back and forth and say "I'm here, I'm here"  "We're now an array."
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Right, right.
    
    
      Yeah.  And that - that seems very uh  easy to believe scenario, I mean, given the number of palm pilots we've got on the table right now, so.
    
    
      That's right.
    
    
      Three, right?  So I guess this a pretty dense group but it- it's getting a lot higher.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah 
    
    
      Yeah, but -  But that - it's 
    
    
      We're not, even, you know  - It's - we're just - It's not like we -
    
    
      We - we may be  technical,  but we're not particularly P_D_A people.
    
    
      So it's - That's just how it is.
    
    
      Well, I'm  trying  to be. So.
    
    
      Well, I know. Well, that's true. I mean.
    
    
      Except I s- got a P_D_A way before - Well I was doing hand- I was doing wearable computers at Boeing, so I guess I sort of count.  But.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      So uh - so where are we  uh now? I mean so we've just -
    
    
      uh We're doing this recording so we show  we can - we're capable of doing recording
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      uh there's  I guess a little more wiring to do or something to have - to have more - if we had more people participating in the meeting we'd wouldn't quite be ready for that.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Uh.
    
    
      Well we've got - we've got - Right now we could have two more people on wireless,  with a trip to Leo's Audio we could get a third extra person on wireless,  and uh  right  now  we could have three more -  three more people wearing mikes like  this,  and that would just work. I mean I'm not sure how -  how good the quality is on this mike but I  think  it's going to be O_K.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      So we  could  actually have  eight people with - with headset mikes  with, I mean, basically no extra effort.
    
    
      Well.
    
    
      Five with wireless.  So we could have eight.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Nine.
    
    
       Nine.  Excuse me, nine. Five with wireless and four without,
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      and four with  wired. 
    
    
      Um, we don't have  headsets though.
    
    
      Yeah. We have the um - the ones we've been using, the ones we got for the P_C.
    
    
      Oh, O_K so we just have to c-  wander around and collect them up.
    
    
      Yeah, yeah. I think we have three of those.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
       So, and the h- 
    
    
      Uh, there's one in my office. So.
    
    
      Right, right.  They don't all work, but the nice ones, the um Plan- Plantronic ones work.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      So, we'll just have to see if that works.
    
    
      So a little bit of futzing, there's the issue about a cabinet, we might want to change some pre-amps.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      So we can do some more recordings but there's - there's a little - little bit of ramp up  on that over the next month,  say.
    
    
      Yeah, yeah.
    
    
      Right and also I would like to work out some of the  software issues a little more  completely. So,
    
    
      um, you know, we're gonna want to resample and con- and bring them over to another machine
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      and uh  um  organize the - how we're gonna store it all.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah we were talking about that a little bit over coffee today, that - that um
    
    
      uh if you  downsample  it sounded like it came - it sounded like it was something like a gig- gigabyte an hour if you didn't downsample and once you downsampled then it was something like four hundred megabytes an hour,
    
    
      if you used all - if you used all - no, if you used all the channels.  Something like that?
    
    
      Per channel, or - ? 
    
    
      We figured out that it was t- twelve gig-
    
    
      It was more than that.
    
    
       twelve  gigabytes an hour?  For - for all the channels?  Was that with or without the -
    
    
      I thought it was  one  gigabyte.
    
    
      It couldn't be  twelve. 
    
    
      Cuz no, we've only - no, I mean we've only got four gigabytes and that
    
    
      We said, four gigabytes  would give us twenty minutes  before we did anything else.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Right. And then we - then we cut it in half.
    
    
      And then we cut in half,  by -
    
    
      How'd you cut it?
    
    
      But -
    
    
      By s-  saving sixteen bits  on  instead of thirty - instead of thirty-two.
    
    
      O_K, so that's - so that's two gigabytes.
    
    
      And then -
    
    
      Well no I mean it's
    
    
      That's forty minutes 
    
    
      uh four gigabytes for forty minutes.
    
    
      Right. But that's at forty four kilohertz with sixteen channels.
    
    
      So, six gigabytes.
    
    
      Forty-eight kilohertz,  yeah.
    
    
      So we can actually  triple  that.
    
    
      So you can - right, so you can
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      So, hang on - so that would - O_K
    
    
      I came out at the gig an hour,  at one point. That - that's one computation I did for sixteen channels, sixteen bit.
    
    
      Well I think it's -
    
    
      I think it's two gig an hour.
    
    
      Is it two gig an hour? I'm off by an order of magni- That's alright. Order of two.   Factor  of two.
    
    
      Cuz like, we don't -  Maybe we don't - We don't need to save all channels, right? So, on average.
    
    
      We could - we don't - we - we wouldn't use all the channels, necessarily.
    
    
      Oh, we'll do the higher math later, maybe but it's - so it's - so maybe like a gig or two a - an hour, um but - um -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      O_K, that is a bit more than I thought.
    
    
      How much here would we have to reformat the drive in there
    
    
      to get some of the more space  cuz it - I mean it's a nine gig drive and
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      there's four gig on sc- on scratch and there's  about three gig unused, it  looked  like, on the  home  directory.
    
    
      I'm sure.  Yeah.
    
    
      I just don't know enough about LINUX. How hard is it to  repartition?
    
    
      It's a pain.
    
    
      It's a pain.
    
    
      I mean, you know, because - cuz we've got data on "user", right? And then we'd have to
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      back it all up and  copy it back on again.
    
    
      Yeah so this'll take some thought cuz we have - we -
    
    
      um
    
    
      If we are in fact gonna have forty or fifty hours at some point and we - we wanna ha- have part of our work be
    
    
      on feature extraction, it means that we need to have waveforms available  somehow.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      Right. So I've - I've already created a "U_ - U_, doctor speech, data, M_R" directory,
    
    
       or had Jane do it and uh
    
    
       um -
    
    
      but there's not a lot of free space around.
    
    
       So it - it - it has currently about four gig
    
    
      No.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      on the drive that I think she's going to put it on um.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      And so we need - we definitely need to go  buy  uh  you know forty gig - fifty gig of drive - drive space.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      We don't need all - we don't necessarily need it all on-line. I mean it will be different subsets.  So you won't - you won't, you know, do all  sixteen channels in a single -
    
    
      That's true. I hadn't even thought about that,
    
    
      although it'd be kind of interesting.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      What would you do? I mean -
    
    
      You typically train - I mean you'd have fi- you'd have fifty hours we'd only use  one of the P_Z_M channels, something like this, and so that would- you wouldn't have to use all sixteen channels  at once.
    
    
      But it's kind of   painful  for -
    
    
      because basically,
    
    
      if we put them on C_Ds then each C_D will have  all the channels for one  recording,
    
    
      and then when you want to build the P_files, you just want to get one of those files off each of  the sessions and -
    
    
      Yeah, it's pretty horrible.
    
    
      So what would we  do  for training? So if we're - if we're training distant mi- we'd just use  one  of them?
    
    
      Yeah. Well, maybe  two  of them, but I mean we wouldn't use - we'd only use the distant mikes, right?
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Yeah so it might be  four. 
    
    
      Right? But it wouldn't be  sixteen. 
    
    
      Well, although we wanted to get  alignments  from the  close  mike  stuff.
    
    
      But that's a separate training.
    
    
      Right.  But you don't want to be constantly take - putting that on disk and off disk and on disk.
    
    
      No wait. More disk is better. Absolutely. I mean  my - my preference would be to get - get ourselves a hundred gig of disk.  And just not bother.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      The thing is it's  really  not very  expensive  right now.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      So it's more of an issue of - of structuring it with uh the uh Sys Admin folks so we don't panic them and
    
    
      And back up.
    
    
      figuring out where it goes.
    
    
      Well, we don't - it doesn't need to be backed up.
    
    
      Right if - if we -
    
    
      if we burn it all on C_D-ROM,
    
    
      Right, then it doesn't need to be backed up.
    
    
      then,
    
    
      um, in fact, we could
    
    
      you know - we could throw away the Broadcast News stuff and put it on there or something like that.
    
    
      Yeah, we were talking about that. I'm not sure if anyone's  still using it.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I think the only one using it has been Javier,
    
    
      Somebody used it recently.
    
    
      but at this point I think it's - he's  only  been using it for features that he calculated quite a while ago,
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      so if nobody else is doing  feature calculation -
    
    
      I'll send mail to speech local.
    
    
       I'll send mail to speech local and see if anyone's still using it.
    
    
      Pardon?
    
    
      How much space is that using up? Do you have any idea?
    
    
      It's uh twenty C_Ds, so that's twelve gigabytes.
    
    
      So that would last us for a while.
    
    
      Yeah, couple hours!
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Well, anyway for this - this recording we're fine cuz we're only - we're only - how many mikes are we recording right now?
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Well, right now we don't have any choice. It r- still records all sixteen channels. It's just most of them are all zeroes.
    
    
      So that - that's on our list too.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, well that we can
    
    
      do something about.
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      It's mostly a question of user interface. How do we - how do we specify which ones are on?
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, so we don't store any of our audio formats compressed in any way do we?
    
    
      So these large sections when you guys aren't talking -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       Probably,  we could - we could probably just run Shorten on them or something and it will get a big win.
    
    
      I think that's a good -
    
    
      Run  what  on those?
    
    
      Shorten.
    
    
      Tony Robinson's  uh lossless compression thing.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      What's  it  do?
    
    
      Um,
    
    
      it - 
    
    
      it does  A_R  modeling
    
    
       and so it looks at a section,
    
    
       it runs an A_R model to sort of r- w- to  whiten  it
    
    
       and then quantizes  the residual  with a nice - with the three bits it can get away with. Something like that.
    
    
      So I think it - On - on each block it'll -  it'll compress you know if there's  load on in any range  it'll use ratio bits. I  think  it does that.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah, so, P_Z_Ms.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, well.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, it's something that - that we definitely need to look at with this.
    
    
      Maybe we shouldn't've  subsampled it down to sixteen bits  for our first try.
    
    
      Well, it's O_K, it's only the first try. I - what I'm thinking is um  obviously we can do the - we can - we can choose any sixteen bits from the  twenty- four, so we can just have different gain things that we use  you know per channel.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah, so we might wanna see if maybe the low sixteen bits on the P_Z_Ms are better than the middle  sixteen bits.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I think -   probably  the bottom four bits are not any good,
    
    
      Regardless, yeah.
    
    
      Right? Although you know it  claims  they are. But probably
    
    
      the -
    
    
      W- I was just noticing on the - on the - there's a view meter, software view meter and the P_Z_M gain is real low.  So.
    
    
      Yeah, so I think  initially  we should take up more space until we've analyzed this and get a better sense of it because
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
       uh we don- I mean we're not talking about forty or fifty hours at this point we're talking about  a half hour of - of speech and so
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       uh we should look at this carefully  but -
    
    
      Yeah, I was  interested when I saw the twenty-four on there. Wow, I mean that's probably  eight  bits of noise. Yeah. So.
    
    
      Oh, yeah!
    
    
      Oh yeah!
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah, that's right.  We've got  lots  of bits of noise.
    
    
      These  theories things  are pretty amazing.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       And 
    
    
       And there's  help - help they seem - they seem good though they seem to be
    
    
      It's some sort of oversampling thing I imagine, right?
    
    
      Didn't we already get that? Cuz you -
    
    
      Oh, God knows. Yeah, yeah.
    
    
      you can't have  uh component tolerances that are  uh  sixteen million - one in sixteen million parts, so.
    
    
      
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Right the other - other thing  another issue is just getting a sound card up here.
    
    
      You know, I assumed that we could just put a sound blaster in if we want sound output.
    
    
      That - that card - that machine's got sound - They've got a sound blaster built into it.
    
    
      Oh, it's just not working.
    
    
      I just - I just disabled it cuz I wanted to find out
    
    
       how well the  sound infrastructure would deal with both at once
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
       but I think yeah, that's, uh -
    
    
       probably it will be fine.
    
    
      Yeah, that way we don't - we can't listen to it  on this machine.
    
    
      I'm s-
    
    
      There's no,
    
    
      Oh!
    
    
      
    
    
      For a couple of reasons.
    
    
      Well, but the  - 
    
    
      There are  two  ways we  could  listen to it. There's a sound - there's actually sound output built into  this  thing.  But the driver - I haven't - the driver may not support it yet.  And then there's also the sound or the sound card built in. But I don't know how to - I don't know how the  operating system would like having two sound cards.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      But we can F_T_P stuff over, right? So  it's connected.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      And we've  looked  at it so we know it's working. I mean, you can see the little squiggles, and it looks like speech  so   You just can't listen.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Um.
    
    
      One suggestion I have is that um
    
    
      I think this -  maybe we should just read some more - you made more of these, right? I think we should read some more
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      O_K. 
    
    
      because - because this is very f- we -
    
    
       we need to - to work the - the - the uh - the talkers more because we're not gonna have  that  many meetings
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      and this is a pretty  tiny  amount of data.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      So maybe we should do another   number list and  -
    
    
      Well right I - I just did ten per page I could easily do twenty per page.
    
    
       It's just a question of uh  of how much uh annoyance I wanted to put uh people going to meetings through.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Well this is us. We'll have a fair amount of annoyance yeah I think  uh.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      So, can we do - we do another set? Are we - are we - are we - sort of -
    
    
      Sure.
    
    
      Sure.
    
    
      we talked out about what we're -
    
    
      Well no, O_K, the question I still have about what we're going to do is
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      what is - what - eh - O_K, so we can get the equipment set up so that
    
    
      basically we're in a situation where we can -  with, you know, ten minutes of preparation, we can bring  nine people in here and do a  multi- channel recording.
    
    
      Um.
    
    
      What are - wh- When are we - Are we going to do that? Who are they going to be? What meetings are we going to record?
    
    
      Us, to begin with.
    
    
      So which - which meetings - What meetings do we have?
    
    
      I think that's the intention.
    
    
      I mean like "us" being the Meeting Recorder people or "us" being anything that speech  local does.
    
    
      Well, I think - 
    
    
      I think, um, certainly us, Meeting Recorder. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Um, us  other  groups. It just depends on how  many  meetings we're - we're having. Um.
    
    
       Jerry  also said it would be -  he  would be willing to have  his  group, some of the A_I meetings do it as well.
    
    
      And we should have like - we should have Decoder meetings and stuff.
    
    
      And uh
    
    
      Exactly exactly. I think there are enough  incidental meetings for us to - to do this. And if  we can get it set up so it is convenient enough,
    
    
      um, then you can just do  spontaneous  meetings as well.
    
    
      Yeah, I mean that's the thing. It's O_K to g-
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Which  I'm  interested in. I mean, that's one of the things, the whole reason I want a P_D_A as opposed to a wired room
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      is for spontaneous meetings.
    
    
      Well, we've got to make it really really easy to start it going then in that case. Cuz that - that's the real  goal.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      That's right.
    
    
      That's why I put  ten  on here instead of thirty or forty or fifty.
    
    
      Right. But I mean if we - if we want  Jerry's group to  use it then we probably  won't ask them to read any numbers, right? Cuz.
    
    
      Right. Well, I - I bet they would be willing to do it the first few times, just for the novelty.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      I think they would.
    
    
      And also he's - he's - he's got  at  least  one  woman. 
    
    
      
    
    
      That's great. I know.
    
    
      Oh, that's a good  point!  
    
    
      And we're - we have a little problem of  no women,
    
    
      Boy, that's abs- I had never - I hadn't even thought about that.
    
    
      I know, it's a disaster.
    
    
      Yeah, well, when L- when Liz uh Shriberg starts coming, then there's another woman although she -
    
    
      Oh, man!
    
    
      It's alright she doesn't mind as long as we don't video her, right?
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Ah, that's right. That was it. So.
    
    
      
    
    
      Maybe we should have the reading group here and force Jane to come.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah. No, well, actually we could have Jane uh - Jane's interested and curious about this stuff so she could attend one of - probably not the decoder meeting but some of the other stuff she  would be interested enough and have her read -
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      We could - we could have the reading group in here. Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah, I mean it's a different  style.  But I think that's alright.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       I mean. 
    
    
      Yeah, it's great.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Um,   we were joking about having lunch up here but eating with the microphones -  
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Um,  I had another question  briefly  about  transcription.  So  are  we going get an external service or are  we  gonna do it? I mean who's gonna  generate the transcripts?
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      Um
    
    
      I think that one of the neat things about having this little  pilot  thing from today
    
    
      is we should try it a couple different ways,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      so we should  try to do it internally, maybe ask - ask Jane if we could get her to do it or - or - or have her  supervise a linguistics student or somebody
    
    
      Mm-hmm
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
       and uh see how long it takes, and you know, multiply out the cost, and then send -
    
    
      send the same thing out, or maybe split it in halves or something - something like that
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      to a - to an outside service
    
    
      and uh see what  that  costs and how much hassle that is.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      And then we can
    
    
      Yeah, the - the  problem  of course is that it's  you know, in - in this meeting it's three four five six seven eight, it's  nine  transcripts,  potentially.
    
    
      assess it.
    
    
      
    
    
      Well,
    
    
      Except that you wouldn't transcribe them all individually, right? You would send - I mean,
    
    
      No.
    
    
       uh a transcriber is used - I mean, I don't know, assume - presumably a transcriber  transcribes a single meeting, right? And so they - they just have to  indicate that the  speaker changes.
    
    
      No.
    
    
      Right. This was - this was the point of having near zero skew. Right?
    
    
      Right?
    
    
      So you just pick one,
    
    
      with the best sounding one, and give it to somebody and they transcribe it.
    
    
      Oh, you're right, yeah, yeah, yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      So  the only thing we'll have to be careful with is that they're -  well,  what  are they  listening  to?
    
    
      So - so they - they're gonna - they're gonna have to make speaker assignments  or something like this.
    
    
      They're going to have to make speaker assignments, and wh- and  which  recording are they gonna  listen  to?
    
    
      For one of - one of .
    
    
      Or we could mix - we could mix the - the headset mikes, you know, just to make a single
    
    
      high q- high quality -
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Oh, that would be interesting.
    
    
      and we could do -
    
    
      and we could do all kinds of weird things like having you know squelch so that  you only, you know - you only - you
    
    
      cut it out when there's no energy. So you don't  noise.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah, you could do fancy things, but it seems like that's enough.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      I mean there's - it's -
    
    
      O_K.
    
    
      If we - if we do something which is have a little bit of human input to get the words
    
    
      then we can  leverage that a lot
    
    
      by some  clever cross thing  to figure out which channel they really belong to and stuff like this,
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      probably.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yet.
    
    
      So that - I mean, that's  one  chunk of work and just  segmenting  for  this  is gonna be  another  chunk of work. 
    
    
      Um.
    
    
      Yeah. And - Yeah. As much work as you want.
    
    
      
    
    
      Yeah
    
    
      But uh I don't know. This meeting,  so,  say it's maybe going to be a half hour or something, and -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
       and uh we've heard estimates ranging between ten and twenty  times uh real time to do this kind of transcription
    
    
      um  so you know in - in principle then it'll take somebody a day for somebody to deal with this.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.  Wow. 
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      And uh we'll see  which one of those seems closest to right and if they -
    
    
      
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
       ramped up, if towards the end it was faster you know, get some sort of sense from them
    
    
      uh from whoever does it
    
    
      and um then uh
    
    
      like I say, check it out with an external service and see  if it's faster, cheaper, better, worse, whatever. Then we'll go from there.
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Yeah, one of the things I was thinking with transcript is that if we  take  the near field
    
    
      and  we do an initial  recognition pass, is it easier for a transcriber to  correct  a transcript,
    
    
      if the  near field mike does a reasonably good job?
    
    
      Hmm.
    
    
      I bet it  isn't, 
    
    
      Yeah. 
    
    
      unless it's really close to  right. 
    
    
      
    
    
      I have - just because it's such an un-
    
    
      The  transcribing  is sort of something I can imagine doing,
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      whereas having this distraction
    
    
      of having sort of something that  looks  like it might be right but has got some 
    
    
      Some errors, yeah.
    
    
      very wrong bits in
    
    
      is sort of a less - less easy thing to do.
    
    
      I don't know. I do- I don't know the answer to that.
    
    
      I'm sure the professional transcribers obviously don't have any use for -
    
    
      I don't know.
    
    
      Yeah
    
    
      Well, I mean there's this Cyber Transcriber service, right?
    
    
      Yeah, that's true, that's true.
    
    
      And at least  supposedly  the way they work is by feeding them
    
    
      Yeah, by fixing up  transcripts.
    
    
       what is  the output of the recognizer.
    
    
      So maybe it depends on what the software tools are like.
    
    
      If it's - you know, if they can easily flip through stuff and get to the right thing, or do you point, or I don't know.
    
    
      Yeah, but - Yeah.
    
    
      There's supposed to be some out - out - out-of-work shepherders or something in  Scotland but -
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      Ah, the internet.
    
    
      They  should  all be in  India  right now. That's where the good, but the cheap English speakers are.
    
    
      Yeah.
    
    
      Inexpensive.
    
    
      Not in Scotland.
    
    
      
    
    
      I'm sorry, yeah.
    
    
      Not in Scotland. 
    
    
      Well they don't speak  such clear English 
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      They - they sheep - they s- they - they speak  cheap  English, right?
    
    
      
    
    
      O_K so we're degenerating, right. Are - are - are we done with uh M_R business, or - ? 
    
    
      Yep.
    
    
      Sure.
    
    
       I mean what- what's - maybe we should - what are our action items? So there's - there's the continuing process of  cleaning up the stuff and making it easier to do that.
    
    
       There's taking  the results of this meeting  and putting it in some kind of decent form, probably getting  some kind of single channel  merged sum data or something so that you can give a simple  sound file of some sort to a transcriber
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      Mm-hmm.
    
    
      to deal with it rather than this massive thing. That's a little bit of  stuff to do. Right?
    
    
      Right.
    
    
      And then  do some segmenting and recognition - initial recognition
    
    
      would be interesting to do.
    
    
      Yeah, although it - it - it - it may be separating out these numbers  from the rest. Yeah.
    
    
      That's what I mean.
    
    
      And then
    
    
      Yeah just doing a digits on it - uh, connected digits.
    
    
      Yeah  and uh
    
    
      Right.

      How many more you got?
    
    
      Oh I on- I did ten but I can - I have a script to generate them automatically. 
    
    
      Well, let's do some more while we got them here.
    
    
      Wow.
    
    
      O_K. 
    
    
      
    
    
      What fun  it is.
    
    
      Well, you know, it's not, but
    
    
      It's interesting that um it m- it's not clear whether it's better to have them written as - as words or - or   figures. 
    
    
      But, of course, to get zero and "O_"s distinguished we - you have to do it.
    
    
      That's why, yep.
    
    
      But  it's kind of weird to read.
    
    
      O_K, this is uh Morgan again with the wireless lapel, transcript six.

      So, is it - it's going to disk, or is this -
