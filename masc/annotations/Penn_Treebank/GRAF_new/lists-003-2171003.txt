Yes , I think that 's exactly right .
We can probably adjust the comment in the .pinerc for now .
In the long term the .pinerc needs a lot of good error checking .
It just has n't been done because limited resources .
All of the RFC 1345 character sets are registered for MIME use .
That should be able to cover most needs .
