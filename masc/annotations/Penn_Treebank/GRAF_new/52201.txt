Vince , I agree with you that it 's a lesson people need to learn over and over again .
I ca n't tell you how many politicians I met over the past year who really do n't like markets and certainly do n't understand how or why they work .
These are n't just the minor leaguers in Sacramento , but the big league players in Washington .
I also agree that the academic community can play " an important role in shaping public opinion and in explaining the logic of deregulation process . "
I 'd like to think that is in large part what I have been trying to do .
Frank
