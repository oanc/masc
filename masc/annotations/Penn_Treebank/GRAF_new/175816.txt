Subject : ABX1 70 Further Nail in Generator 's Coffin -- Absurdity in CA
I just heard about this bill by La Seur
ABX1 70 attempts to criminalize acts of unregulated generators if they perform maintenance at times other than the California Public Utilities Commission requires .
Further , the commission is required to allow scheduled maintenance of only one generator at a time .
So , with 500 generators in the state , just how many years would it take to complete one round of maintenance ?
Also , please note it does not apply to munis .
