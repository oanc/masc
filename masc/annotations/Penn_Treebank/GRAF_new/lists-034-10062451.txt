subject = " RE : Merged Transport Layer Protocol Development "
Tls - draft was created specifically as a forum for the discussion of the Microsoft STLP strawman document .
The reason for this is that the STLP strawman document is not an official IETF document .
Win Treese , Microsoft and Netscape did not want this document to be confused in any way with the actual spec that is being developed by the working group .
However , since the consensus of the emails is to discuss the STLP strawman document on ietf-tls , then Microsoft does not object .
To facilitate the discussion , you can find the STLP strawman document at : http:$$$$pct.microsoft.com$$stlp .
Tom Stephens
David made some excellent points regarding STLP .
These points and others will be discussed in some detail on tls-draft@w3.org - as that is the alias for discussion of the STLP strawman document .
If you are not a member of that alias , I would strongly encourage you to join and participate in the discussion .
To join the tls-draft alias , send an mail to tls-draft-request@w3.org with the word " subscribe " in the subject line .
Perhaps I do n't understand IETF procedure , but I am puzzled as to why there is now a second mailing list .
It 's not like the original TLS list is getting too much traffic .
In fact , it 's not getting enough traffic ... for one , I ca n't find any reference to any mail that included the URL for the STLP " strawman " .
Where is it ?
