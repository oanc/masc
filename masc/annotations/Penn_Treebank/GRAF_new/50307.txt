Subject : Security question
Dear guys Having been out of the office for a couple of days , I 've found myself the victim of theft again .
This time my desk drawer key has been stolen from its " hiding place " under my telephone .
I always lock my drawers and keep the key in the same place , but on arriving in the office today I found the drawers unlocked , and the key missing .
Although there 's nothing sensitive on or around my desk , I 'm concerned about the security implications of someone sniffing around the office in this manner .
I also found the papers on my desk extensively reshuffled last week .
Last year , in our old office , I had my only two real options books stolen from among the many and varied books on my desk .
That could n't have been a random theft , and I fear this is n't either .
I ca n't understand who 'd be so interested in a Research guy 's belongings !
Can we ask security to check their surveillance footage for any suspicious activity around my desk ?
Cheers , Steve
