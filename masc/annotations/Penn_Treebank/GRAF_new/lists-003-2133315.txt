Yes , I think that 's exactly right .
We can probably adjust the comment in the .pinerc for now .
In the long term the .pinerc needs a lot of good error checking .
It just has n't been done because limited resources .

So , perhaps Pine could have US-ASCII , ISO-2022-JP , and the various ISO-8859-x sets wired in as an initial list , and the system file specify additional valid sets ?
The concern is to avoid letting users do things like set it to things such as `` Latin-1 '' or `` ASCII '' or similar bogons ...
What do you think ?
