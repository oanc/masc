While reading the discussion between Bruce Smith and Ron Whitney , I have come to the conclusion that the plug-in solution will not work , because we need the possibility of anchor's within math , and math in text in math .
I 'd like to see what you all think about this , since this is what Dave proposed e.g. at the DLI Math meeting in Illinois .
I agree that today 's plug-in api's are inadequate and am working to get this fixed .
You can however make anchors within plugins work .
The plugin is passed mouse events and can in turn call back to the browser to display a URL .
This is enough to allow anchor's within math , and math in text in math , with the burden placed on the plugin .
