Subject : Dearest One ,
Dearest One , Please I know very well that this mail might come to you as a surprise , I am Mrs Dagmar a dying woman who has decided to donate what I have to the Church , Mosque or any Charity Organization round your community through your assistance since I will not be able to do this here in my community for the reason which I will explain to you later .
I was diagnosed for cancer for about 4 years now after the death of my husband Dr. Patrick Irlandese who has left me everything he worked for .
My doctors told me I will not live longer than some weeks because of my health
I decided to WILL $$ DONATE the sum of 4.5 Million to you since I do n't have a child rather than allowing my late husband 's relatives that compare for his death to use my late husband hard earned funds ungodly .
For the fact no one else knows the existence of this fund in the family , As my late husband warned me not to disclose this issue to any of his brethren before his death .
So Please you should contact me immediately if you accept to carry on this project with your complete contact informations Comprising your Complete Names , Address , Direct Telephone and Your occupation so that I can put you in contact with the establishment where the money was deposited or a lawyer to enable you arrange with them on how to secure the money for the purpose mentioned above , I ca n't predict what will be my fate by the time you will receive the funds , But you should please ensure that the fund is used as I have described above .
You should reply urgently for more explanation .
Best Regards , Mrs Dagmar Irlandese
