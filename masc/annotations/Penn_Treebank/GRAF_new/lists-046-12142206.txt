subject = " more comments on HTML - Math proposal "
I 've read the proposal from Wolfram Research again .
Some more comments : I agree with Ron Whitney , and should have said so before , that the effort that has gone into this proposal is substantial , and this is really concrete stuff we can " chew on " .
I also had the feeling for some time , and the same feeling exists in the SGML community , that the developments of HTML - Math and of HTML in general were suffering from a NIH syndrome .
I also see that extensible languages are hard to realize within the possibilities of the SGML language .
I certainly support the use of ISO TR 9573 entity names for mathematical and technical symbols , as I have written earlier .
While reading the discussion between Bruce Smith and Ron Whitney , I have come to the conclusion that the plug-in solution will not work , because we need the possibility of anchor's within math , and math in text in math .
I 'd like to see what you all think about this , since this is what Dave proposed e.g. at the DLI Math meeting in Illinois .
