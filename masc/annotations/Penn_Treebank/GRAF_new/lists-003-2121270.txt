subject = " Re : CHARSET considerations "
Steve - Thanks for your comments .
You need n't convince me ; I 've been involved with the MIME charset issue for a long time you 'll note that I am one of the authors of the ISO-2022-JP spec .
In defense of the other Pine team members , the sin is one of omission rather than of comission ; they wanted to do something about character sets and did n't want to wire in a table of legal values since it might change .
I 've suggested that as a first pass the charset should only be settable in the system config file , and that the charset always be coerced to US-ASCII unless the text contains 8 - bit characters and $$ or has `` funny '' control characters such as ESC or SI$$SO .
More work would definitely be needed in this area , but you 'll appreciate that there are other , higher priorities just now ...
