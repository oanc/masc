Little Shelter 33 Warner Road Huntington NY 11743-0830
Dear Ms. Last Name These are the pawprints of a homeless animal ; an abandoned animal , shivering with fear , with no place to call home .
Where will these pawprints lead ?
With your help they can lead to Little Shelter RSQUOs good food , medical attention and a warm place to sleep for homeless and frightened animals .
And then we RSQUOll work to find loving homes for them
You might be wondering how much to send .
Our average gift is about $ 21 .
If you could give $ 20 or more , I can promise we RSQUOll use your money to help animals start new , happier lives .
At this wonderful time of the year , when people are celebrating ,
" The only no - kill shelter that RSQUOs there when you need us "
Little Shelter is crowded with animals waiting for homes .
It hurts us especially now to see a scrawny dog ... a wet , starving kitten . homeless animals that would otherwise die if Little Shelter did n?t provide the care , treatment and love these animals need .
If you could see them , I know you would want to help .
Your reward will be the wag of a tail you RSQUOll never see , the soft purr you RSQUOll never hear -- and the warm joy of knowing you were there to help when you were needed .
Happy Holidays from all of us !
Sincerely , Maryann Chernovsky President
P.S. Please accept the enclosed 2001 calendar and gift tags as a special greeting from our animal friends and Little Shelter .
