subject = " Re : IETF BOF "
Borka , Hi !
I 'd like to request that the scheduling for the Character Set BOF be done so that it does not conflict with any of the other information service working groups IIIR , IDS , OSI-DS , URI , for example as I and I suspect most of the information service people feel we need to attend this BOF .
The interest will be quite high , I think .
Thanks for getting this together .
