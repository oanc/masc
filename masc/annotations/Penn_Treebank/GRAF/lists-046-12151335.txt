I view their contributions as wholly positive .
I 'm certain that Nico was not asserting otherwise , but I would
Ron is right : I was not trying to assert otherwise , but I was asking a question perhaps not neutrally enough :--RRB- , because I am only vaguely familiar with Mathematica .
I asked the question because I wanted to know how feasible the mechanisms are that Bruce describes .
If Mathematica already implements something similar , this is an argument in support of feasibility .
It also might give an indication of how easy or difficult it is to come up with a real implementation .
I agree with Ron that there is some politics involved as well .
I think this group should make it absolutely clear that we will draw inspiration from ISO 12083 as much as we need , and that we will use the ISO TR 9573 entity sets , and also that WRI is not " running the show " .
As an aside : at the SGML Europe '96 conference Roy Pike attended the meeting of the committee responsible for ISO 12083 , chaired by Eric van Herwijnen , and we got him to consent to the idea that there will always be users who need $$ insist on a P-LRB-resentation-RRB- geometric , visual notation .
I said " he consented " , but I should have said " he consented grudgingly and certainly not wholeheartedly " .
:--RRB-

The truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth .
And maybe some compromises .
