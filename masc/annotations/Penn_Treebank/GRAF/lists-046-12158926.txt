subject = " Re : Comments on parsing steps : "
Mathematica 's parsing , which works in a manner similar to what Bruce describes , has no problem handling complex embellishments .
I can see value in allowing prefix and postfix operators to act as operator embellishments , for instance to add accents to operators or to change their relative size , or position .
If these embellishment prefix and postfix operators have a high precedence and hence bind tightly to the adjacent operator then I do n't see any problems .
Am I missing something ?
I think that there is a problem with prefix embellishments .
The arguments are technical , so people who do n't care can stop reading .
When the parser encounters something like a +_2 b , it knows by the time of reading the ' + ' that it must have a right operand .
The most reasonable " error correction " would be to have the ' _ ' embellishe ' + ' .
However , consider the following : &bold + 2 with ' &bold ' being a high - precedence prefix operator .
When the parser sees the ' + ' , it sees that it must be a prefix operator , and so will shift the ' 2 ' on .
So , this expression would result in : &bold + 2
To get what you probably wanted , you would need to write &bold + 2
For a large number of cases , such as ' &bold x + 2 ' , the right thing would happen .
It is just when you try to embellish an operator .
A high - precedence postfix &bold would not have this problem .
Since the details of why a prefix embellishing operator sometimes " works " right and sometimes does n't are probably beyond most authors , I think we should avoid them .
Or if we must have them , tell people to always uses braces to properly group it .
