In composing a longer piece about concerns here , I have a couple of smallish , focused questions .
I 'll ask them in the context of integrals .
Dave proposes something on the order of integral from ... to ... of ... \ d x for an " ordinary " integral .
1. How will we handle the variants on this theme such as multiple integrals to be rendered with multiple integral signs , path integrals , etc. ?
2. Is there a specific reason we do n't want to use the TeX-like notation : \int_{...}^{...} ... ?
because the _ and ^ operators become " too " overloaded ?
