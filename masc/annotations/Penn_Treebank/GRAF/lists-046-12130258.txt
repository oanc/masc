subject = " Re : Comments on parsing steps : "
From first reading , it appears that the step of " parsing embellishments " e.g. superscripts , accents etc needs to happen before the operator precedence parsing step .
Also , this will allow us to handle complex expressions appearing as embellishments to other complex expressions correctly .
Mathematica 's parsing , which works in a manner similar to what Bruce describes , has no problem handling complex embellishments as in your example .
Perhaps I am too familar with the algorithm and that I filled in pieces missing in Bruce 's description , but I did n't see anything wrong with his description .
Do you have a simple example in mind where it fails ?
