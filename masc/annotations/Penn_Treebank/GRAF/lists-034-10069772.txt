No , there will not be two standards .
Microsoft and Netscape are working with the IETF to create one IETF standard which both companies can support .
Subject : RE : Merged Transport Layer Protocol Development
strawman document is not an official IETF document .
Win Treese , Microsoft and Netscape did not want this document to be confused in any way with the actual spec that is being developed by the working group .
I 'm yet to read the document in detail but this sounds like we are going to have a IETF - Standard and an a separate NS $$ MS standard ???
This is not a good thing .
read you later
