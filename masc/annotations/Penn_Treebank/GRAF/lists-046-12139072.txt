subject = " Re : Comments on parsing steps : "
Mathematica 's parsing , which works in a manner similar to what Bruce describes , has no problem handling complex embellishments .
I can see value in allowing prefix and postfix operators to act as operator embellishments , for instance to add accents to operators or to change their relative size , or position .
If these embellishment prefix and postfix operators have a high precedence and hence bind tightly to the adjacent operator then I do n't see any problems .
Am I missing something ?
