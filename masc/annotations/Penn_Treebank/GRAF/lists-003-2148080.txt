Plain text is defined differently from system to system .
On UNIX , plain text is ASCII now ISO-8859-1 with lines delimited by NL actually LF .
On NT , plain text is 16 bits wide so I hear .
That ai n't ASCII , though we could be the high - order 8 bits for much of plain text processing , and that 's fine by me .
memory is cheap
On VM$$CMS , plain text is EBCDIC now CodePage 1047 and records are handled by the filesystem out - of - band of the data , so NL and LF and CR are n't sacred characters .
Now ... " mail is plain - text , not ASCII " .
Please , gentlemen ..... read the RFC .
As long as you send mail over the Internet , claiming MIME compatibility , the bits on the wire have to conform to the MIME convention , NOT to the local convention , whatever that is .
The omission of a character set label from text $$ plain MEANS THAT THE CHARACTER SET IS US ASCII .
A message that contains characters with the high bit set CAN NOT BE US-ASCII , and therefore , a text $$ plain message without a charset= label in it that has such characters IS NOT LEGAL MIME .
So , when SMTP strips the 8th bit , it gets what it deserves .
This was NOT an oversight .
This was deliberate design , designed to promote interoperability .
The proliferation of mail in strange character sets without labels is exactly one of the things that the MIME effort was meant to remove .
End of flame .............. if you want a couple of tons more , read the archives of the SMTP and RFC-822 groups .
The last flareup is hidden under " unknown - 7bit " and " unknown - 8bit " discussions .
