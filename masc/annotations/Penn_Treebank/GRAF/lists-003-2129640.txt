subject = " Re : CHARSET considerations "
Hi Laurence - Perhaps all that is needed is a list in the system .pinerc file of all the valid charsets , and not let the user set her charset to one that is not in the list .
So , perhaps Pine could have US-ASCII , ISO-2022-JP , and the various ISO-8859-x sets wired in as an initial list , and the system file specify additional valid sets ?
The concern is to avoid letting users do things like set it to things such as `` Latin-1 '' or `` ASCII '' or similar bogons ...
What do you think ?
