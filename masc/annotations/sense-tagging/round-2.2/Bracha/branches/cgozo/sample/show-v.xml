Lung fibroblasts respond, in vitro , to inflammatory cytokines by producing growth factors and collagen, resulting in fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition [ 2 3 4 ] . In addition, activated lung fibroblasts have been &lt;b&gt;shown&lt;/b&gt; to produce large amounts of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, in vitro , and hence, these cells may also have a role as effector-inflammatory cells [ 1 2 ] . This capacity to produce both inflammatory and fibrotic factors could mean that phenotypically altered lung fibroblasts act simultaneously as effector and target cells, via paracrine and autocrine mechanisms, perpetuating the fibrotic process [ 2 ] .</s>

DNA competition analysis &lt;b&gt;showed&lt;/b&gt; that KRC fusion proteins containing the ZAS-C domain bind specifically to both the RSS and to the κB motif [ 14 28 ] . DNA footprinting analysis further &lt;b&gt;showed&lt;/b&gt; that KRC/ZAS-C binds to specific nucleotides within the κB and the heptamer of the RSS [ 14 ] . In this study, using a PCR-based DNA-binding site-selection and amplification procedure, we demonstrated that both the N-terminal ZAS-N and the C-terminal ZAS-C domains are able to bind GT-rich DNA sequences, and confirmed that the RSS and κB motifs are the high-affinity targets of KRC.</s>
