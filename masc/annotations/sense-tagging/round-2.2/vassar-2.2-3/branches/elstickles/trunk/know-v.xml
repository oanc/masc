However little is &lt;b&gt;known&lt;/b&gt; about the regulation of PP5 or its specific role in these pathways, and only one physiological substrate for PP5 has been identified to date, the apoptosis signaling kinase ASK 1 [ 13 ] . PP5 can be activated by lipid in vitro , and removal of the TPR domain or the C terminus generates an active, lipid insensitive form of the enzyme [ 18 19 20 21 ] . PP5 phosphatase activity is also altered by hCRY2 and a fragment of hsp90 in vitro [ 21 22 ] . These findings suggest that PP5 may be autoinhibited and that the binding of protein partners or lipids to the TPR domain could potentially control PP5 activity in cells, however no reports have yet documented how PP5 is regulated in vivo . The activity of PP5 homologs from cauliflower, T. brucei and P. falciparum is stimulated by polyunsaturated fatty acids in vitro [ 7 8 9 10 ] and removal of the TPR domain from P. falciparum PP5 increases activity to the same extent as lipid treatment [ 8 9 ] . This suggests that the TPR domain plays a similar inhibitory role for all PP5 homologs.</s>
