Lung fibroblasts respond, in vitro , to inflammatory cytokines by producing growth factors and collagen, resulting in fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition [ 2 3 4 ] . In addition, activated lung fibroblasts have been &lt;b&gt;shown&lt;/b&gt; to produce large amounts of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, in vitro , and hence, these cells may also have a role as effector-inflammatory cells [ 1 2 ] . This capacity to produce both inflammatory and fibrotic factors could mean that phenotypically altered lung fibroblasts act simultaneously as effector and target cells, via paracrine and autocrine mechanisms, perpetuating the fibrotic process [ 2 ] .</s>
