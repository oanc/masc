Using calibrated needles, Rappaport directly measured the &lt;b&gt;force&lt;/b&gt; that the contractile ring produced [ 2 ] . During the 1970's, nonmuscle myosin-II, the equivalent of the &lt;b&gt;force&lt;/b&gt; producing molecule of skeletal muscle, was shown to localize to the region of the cleavage furrow cortex, suggesting the molecular basis for contractile &lt;b&gt;force&lt;/b&gt; (reviewed in [ 1 3 ] ).
