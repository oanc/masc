The subcellular localization of AtCOP1 is regulated by light in a tissue specific manner [ 14 15 ] . The hypocotyl cell nuclei contain high levels of COP1 in the dark and reduced levels in the light, suggesting that the nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of AtCOP1 is adjusted by a light-responsive mechanism [ 14 16 ] . The activity of AtCOP1 is at least in part regulated by its subcellular localization, as the degradation of HY5 is dependent upon the nuclear accumulation of AtCOP1 in the dark [ 4 ] . AtCOP1 was demonstrated to carry a single, bipartite nuclear localization signal located between the coiled-coil domain and the WD-40 domain (amino acid 294-314) and a cytoplasmic localization signal, which was mapped to a region partially overlapping with the RING finger and the coiled-coil domain (amino acid 67-117) [ 17 ] . Strikingly, AtCOP1 protein forms characteristic nuclear speckles when transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells or stably expressed in transgenic Arabidopsis [ 6 18 ] . The functional role of these speckles is currently unknown; however, a subnuclear localization signal consisting of 58 residues (amino acid 120-177) is required for their formation [ 19 ] .</s>
