Arabidopsis cop1 mutant seedlings are constitutively photomorphogenic even when grown in the dark, and the severe cop1 mutants cause lethality in the late seedling stage, indicating that COP1 is essential for plant development [ 2 3 ] . Arabidopsis COP1 (Arabidopsis thaliana COP1, AtCOP1) is essential for the proteasome-dependent degradation of two transcription factors, HY5 and HYH [ 4 5 ] . These two homologous bZIP-type transcription factors directly interact with AtCOP1 and are capable of binding to light-responsive promoters to activate the transcription of many target genes [ 5 6 ] . Genome wide micro-array analysis shows that AtCOP1 regulates most, if not all, of the light-responsive genes under various light conditions [ 7 8 ] , substantiating the notion that AtCOP1 functions as a crucial developmental switch through targeting key transcription factors for degradation, thereby controlling the light-responsive gene expression and photomorphogenic development.</s>
