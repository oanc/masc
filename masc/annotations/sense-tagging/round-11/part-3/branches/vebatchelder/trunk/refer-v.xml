It encodes for a receptor that functions in intracellular lysosomal enzyme trafficking, transforming growth factor beta activation, and IGF2 degradation (reviewed in [ 15 16 ] ). Granzyme B internalization by the M6P/IGF2R is also required for cytotoxic T cells to induce apoptosis in cells targeted for death, resulting in this receptor being referred to as a &quot;death receptor&quot; [ 17 ] . Elevated IGF2 levels during murine development arising from M6P/IGF2R deficiency result in cardiac abnormalities, cleft palate, fetal overgrowth and perinatal lethality [ 15 18 ] . Furthermore, large offspring syndrome frequently observed in cloned animals is associated with epigenetic changes in gene regulation and decreased M6P/IGF2R expression [ 19 ] . Thus, the M6P/IGF2R plays a crucial role in regulating mammalian fetal growth and development.</s>
