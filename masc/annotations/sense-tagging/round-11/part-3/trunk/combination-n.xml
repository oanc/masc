Preclinical and clinical data suggest that APV has a lower potential to cause lipodystrophy and metabolic abnormalities than other currently available PIs [ 8 9 10 ] . APV has a distinct resistance profile that permits it to be considered as a treatment option for either PI-naïve or PI-experienced patients [ 11 ] . In a 64-week trial in treatment-naïve patients (NZTA4002; n = 302), APV 1200 mg, administered BID (APV1200) with one abacavir 300 mg tablet and one lamivudine 150 mg/zidovudine 300 mg combination tablet (Combivir ®), was as effective as nelfinavir 750 mg three times daily plus Combivir BID, with regard to the proportion of patients achieving HIV-1 RNA &lt;40 copies/mL at week 64: 77% vs 66% (as-treated analysis) [ 12 ] . However, many patients in this trial withdrew prematurely because of adverse events that may have been, in part, related to the high pill burden (16 large 150 mg soft-gelatin capsules daily) associated with APV dosing and excipients contained in the APV formulation available at the time of the trial.</s>

APV offers the convenience of twice-daily (BID) administration with no food or fluid restrictions [ 6 7 ] . Preclinical and clinical data suggest that APV has a lower potential to cause lipodystrophy and metabolic abnormalities than other currently available PIs [ 8 9 10 ] . APV has a distinct resistance profile that permits it to be considered as a treatment option for either PI-naïve or PI-experienced patients [ 11 ] . In a 64-week trial in treatment-naïve patients (NZTA4002; n = 302), APV 1200 mg, administered BID (APV1200) with one abacavir 300 mg tablet and one lamivudine 150 mg/zidovudine 300 mg combination tablet (Combivir ®), was as effective as nelfinavir 750 mg three times daily plus Combivir BID, with regard to the proportion of patients achieving HIV-1 RNA &lt;40 copies/mL at week 64: 77% vs 66% (as-treated analysis) [ 12 ] . However, many patients in this trial withdrew prematurely because of adverse events that may have been, in part, related to the high pill burden (16 large 150 mg soft-gelatin capsules daily) associated with APV dosing and excipients contained in the APV formulation available at the time of the trial.</s>
