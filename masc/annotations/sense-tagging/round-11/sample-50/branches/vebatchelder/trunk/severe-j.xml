In contrast, most cysteine substitutions cause classic MFS with a high frequency of lens dislocation, although some patients in our study did not meet the Ghent criteria for diagnosis of MFS [ 9 ] . Amino-acid substitutions not disrupting disulfide bonds may be associated with fibrillinopathies other than MFS, although mutations in the calcium-binding consensus sequence have been reported in individuals with classic MFS [ 5 10 11 12 ] .

Fourth, a proteoglycan-specific T-cell hybridoma (T-helper-1 type) can induce arthritis in BALB/c mice [ 19 ] .
