Briefly, Hoxc-8 expressing mice are generated in a binary transgenic mouse system [ 44 ] by crossing a transactivator strain (harboring a transgene in which expression of the transcriptional transactivator VP16 is under control of the Hoxc-8 promoter; [ 45 ] ) to a transresponder strain (that carries as a transgene the Hoxc-8 cDNA linked to the ICP4 immediate early gene promoter, which is silent in mice in the absence of VP16; [ 45 46 ] ). Upon combination of both transgenes, the Hoxc-8 transresponder transgene is activated, and Hoxc-8 becomes overexpressed [ 23 ] . This system also allows the generation of transgenic mice with increased gene dosage by superimposition of transgene loci to homozygosity [ 23 44 ] . For the studies reported here, we used the T239 transactivator and the IE-c8-254 transresponder strains.</s>
