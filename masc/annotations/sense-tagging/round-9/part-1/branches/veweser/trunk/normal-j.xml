Phenol red is a weak estrogen with apparent biological effects, and the ERα binding affinity in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) is equivalent to levels of E2 as high as 0.45 nM [ 36 ] . Although relatively low when compared to the E2 levels in pregnancy, this estrogenic binding affinity of PhR is close to that of E2 during the preovulatory peak [ 4 5 ] . Therefore, we included studies with PhR+, PhR-/E2- and PhR-/E2+ media in order to determine the effect of estrogens on differentiation of cultured trophoblast cells (syncytium formation) derived from normal and abnormal placental types.</s>
