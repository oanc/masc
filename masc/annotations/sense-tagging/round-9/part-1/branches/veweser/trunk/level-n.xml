This dysfunction can arise from a variety of mutations within the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene on chromosome 7, which encodes the transmembrane pump responsible for regulating transepithelial ion levels [ 1 2 4 ] . This defect is associated with an increased viscosity of the airway surface fluid, and according to some studies, an altered salt concentration [ 5 6 ] . These and other pleiotropic effects of the CF gene abnormality increase the susceptibility of CF patients to bronchopulmonary bacterial infection by opportunistic pathogens.</s>
