Furthermore, n-3 PUFAs incorporated into animal diets have reduced tumor growth rates in vivo [ 2 3 4 ] . The prevailing hypothesis for the reduction in tumor cell growth, in vitro or in vivo , by supplementing the diet with high levels of n-3 PUFAs has been that the incorporation of n-3 PUFAs into cell membranes of the tumor cells increased the susceptibility of the cells for lipid peroxidation and that the products of lipid peroxidation subsequently accumulated to cytostatic or cytotoxic levels [ 2 5 6 7 ] . It has also been reported that supplementing the diet of cancer xenograft bearing mice with n-3 PUFAs could increase the efficacy of edelfosine [ 8 ] , doxorubicin [ 9 ] , mitomycin [ 10 ] , cyclophosphomide and 5-fluorouracil [ 11 ] or irinotecan [ 12 ] against the tumor.</s>
