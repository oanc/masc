Unlike transporters which move substantial amounts of substrate by design, ion channels function to change membrane potential by the net movement of relatively tiny amounts of charge (~10 picomoles per cm 2membrane to generate a change of 100 mV) [ 14 ] , hence the low proportion of active AQP1 ion channels is consistent with a functional goal of gated ionic signaling that is distinct from that of massive constitutive osmotic water permeability.</s>

Moreover, a quantity of GnRH that will evoke a normal preovulatory LH surge during the period preceding ovulation will induce only a small increase in LH secretion at other stages of the estrous cycle [ 7 ] . Similarly, termination of the preovulatory LH surge appears to be due to desensitization of the gonadotrope to GnRH action; in the sheep, a decrease in LH secretion precedes the decrease in GnRH secretion [ 41 ] , whereas in the rat, although the decrease in GnRH and LH secretion are co-incident [ 7 ] , there is evidence that the gonadotrope is already desensitized to GnRH [ 42 43 ] .</s>

Second, net1(19m') showed a synthetic growth defect when combined with dbf2-1 or the msd2-1 allele of CDC5 .

Nevertheless, because expression of neither Net1(7m) nor Net1(19m') had a major impact on exit from mitosis, any direct effect of Cdc5 on Net1 appears to be minor, and the requirement for Cdc5 in the release of Cdc14 might arise principally from phosphorylation of other release-promoting proteins.</s>

In ovariectomized female rats, on the other hand, phytoestrogen treatments resulted in a dose-dependent improvement of VSM [ 45 ] . This improvement in cognitive ability in phytoestrogen treated females may be due in part to the increased presence of choline acetyltransferase messenger RNA in the frontal cortex, which has been shown to be associated with protection and enhancement of cognitive function [ 45 ] . Furthermore, we have shown that phytoestrogens significantly affect the brain calcium-binding protein calbindin (CALB), which acts as a buffer by binding intracellular calcium and plays an important role in mediating cell proliferation, programmed cell death (apoptosis), and neurotoxicity [ 48 49 50 51 52 ] . This neuroprotective mechanism via CALB appears to be important in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease [ 48 49 50 51 52 ] . Additionally, Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) seems to play an important role in mediating functional neuronal maturation and responses to certain stimuli in the brain [ 53 54 55 ] . The expression of COX-2 is associated with key pathophysiologic events in Alzheimer's disease: deposition of beta-amyloid protein in neuritic plaques within the hippocampus and cortex [ 53 54 55 ] . Of particular importance to this study is the fact that COX-2 has been shown to be influenced by steroidal hormones [ 53 54 55 ] . Therefore, the expression of COX-2 in the frontal cortex may also be hormonally regulated and relevant to cognitive decline.</s>
