The distinction between ML and Bayesian inference is that Bayesian provides probabilities for hypotheses, not probabilities of data given a hypothesis [ 85 87 88 ] . Bayesian analysis uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to approximate posterior probability distributions that are a direct estimation of branch support because they are the true probabilities of the resulting clades under the assumed models, unlike bootstrap values [ 87 88 ] . Additionally, bootstrap values and posterior probabilities derived from Bayesian analyses for multiple data sets appear to be correlated [ 88 ] . The Bayesian analysis was conducted with the software MrBayes 2.0 [ 89 ] . A GTR substitution model with 6 rate frequencies was selected as the most similar model to the Trn+G substitution model (the latter model is not available in MrBayes).</s>
