Lack of cryptochromes results in increased mRNA levels of CLOCK/NPAS2:BMAL1 target genes, including the circadian genes per1 and per2 [ 20 23 ] . The expression of these two genes is viewed as a state variable of the molecular circadian clock or a marker of CLOCK/NPAS2:BMAL1-induced transcription, although at least per1 transcription can also be (rapidly) induced by light [ 40 41 ] , through a CREB-dependent signaling pathway [ 42 43 44 ] .
