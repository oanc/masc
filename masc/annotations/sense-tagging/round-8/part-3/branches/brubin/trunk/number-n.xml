Another study looking at real data found that LD extended over much larger distances and arrived at an estimate as small as 30,000 SNPs, or 1 SNP per 100 kb [ 33 ] . Recent evidence suggests that the genome consists of blocks of high LD (haplotype blocks) separated by recombination hot spots [ 34 ] . Within each block, a limited number of common haplotypes (three to five) typically capture about 90% of all chromosomes, which means that a reduced number of SNPs would be needed to characterize these haplotypes [ 35 ] .

The later process involves the deacetylation and ubiquitylation of the p53 protein by mdm2 [ 28 ] . Inactivation and/or degradation of p53 diminishes the cell ability to undergo apoptosis [ 21 ] .
