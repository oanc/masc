Different Rab proteins reside in specific subcellular membranes or organelles, where they mediate vesicular transport between discrete donor and acceptor compartments in the endocytic or exocytic pathways [ 4 5 ] . Detailed studies of a few Rab proteins ( e.g .; Rab1, Rab5 and Rab9) have led to a general model wherein Rab proteins are presumed to cycle on and off donor and acceptor membranes in connection with changes in their guanine nucleotide state [ 6 7 8 ] . In the active GTP-bound state, Rab proteins associate with budding transport vesicles [ 9 10 11 ] and appear to participate in the assembly of membrane docking complexes [ 12 13 14 ] . Following vesicle fusion with the acceptor compartment and GTP hydrolysis, the inactive GDP-bound Rab is extracted from the membrane by a carrier protein termed guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) [ 15 16 17 ] . The GTPase can then re-enter the transport cycle through nucleotide exchange promoted by a specific exchange factor at the donor vesicle membrane [ 18 19 20 ] . In addition to changes in guanine nucleotide state, the posttranslational prenylation of Rab proteins plays an important role in the cycling mechanism.</s>
