A lowering of serum calcium levels stimulates the secretion of PTH that then activates the renal conversion of inactive 25-hydroxyvitamin D to the active hormonal metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. At the intestine, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, acting through a nuclear receptor, stimulates transcription of vitamin D-mediated genes, including calbindin D, involved in calcium transport thereby acting as the primary hormonal regulator of active intestinal calcium transport [ 3 ] . It is thus likely that any putative key molecular &lt;b&gt;player&lt;/b&gt; in calcium absorption, such as CaT1 or ECaC1, should be a prime target for hormonal regulation by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. However, to date, neither CaT1 nor ECaC1 expression has been shown to be related to serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D or vitamin D status [ 10 16 ] .</s>
