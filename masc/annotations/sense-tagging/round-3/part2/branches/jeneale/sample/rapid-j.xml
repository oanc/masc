Consistent with another study, we found that in the mid 1980s up to 50% or more of all prostate cancer cases were incidentally detected through TURPs [ 41 ] . However, as medications with few side effects became available to treat benign prostatic hypterplasia and PSA screening became widely adopted, TURP-detected cases declined from their peak in 1987 through 1993 [ 41 ] . Our results showed a similar decline in the TURP-detected prostate cancer incidence rates, followed by a leveling off between 1994 and 1999, for both LDS and nonLDS cases in Utah.</s>

The dynamics of adaptation are well known: after a period of &lt;b&gt;rapid&lt;/b&gt; adaptation during the first 1,000 generations, the rate of improvement has subsequently slowed to almost one-thirtieth of the initial rate [ 20 27 ] . Moreover, relatively few mutations generated this early, &lt;b&gt;rapid&lt;/b&gt; adaptation [ 19 20 24 ] . Thus, these populations have experienced two types of dynamics: one of &lt;b&gt;rapid&lt;/b&gt; adaptation followed by one of much slower improvement.</s>
