Conceptus release of estrogen induces an acute phase response by the endometrium that alters the uterine environment, which may be unfavorable for less developed littermates [ 1 6 ] . Because the pig has a diffuse epitheliochorial type of placentation, &lt;b&gt;rapid&lt;/b&gt; trophoblastic elongation provides an essential biological function to satisfy the conceptus' necessity for maximal placental-uterine contact to ensure adequate nutrient exchange throughout gestation [ 2 ] .</s>

Expression of the RIIβ regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase is highly induced (50-fold) at the mRNA level in primary cultures of rat Sertoli cells as a late response to cAMP peaking at 12 hours [ 16 ] . We have demonstrated that expression of CAAT/Enhancer binding protein β (C/EBPβ) is induced by cAMP with &lt;b&gt;rapid&lt;/b&gt; kinetics in Sertoli cells, and that C/EBPβ is responsible for induction of late response genes like the RIIβ-gene [ 17 ] . The RIIβ promoter contains a conserved E-box/HLH element in the basal promoter localized at -280 to -275 relative to the functional ATG [ 18 ] . This element is shown to be important for cAMP-responsiveness in granulosa cells, and it has been shown to bind both USF and Myc in CHO and NB2a cells [ 18 19 ] . In this work, we show that USF isoforms may regulate cAMP responsiveness of the RIIβ promoter by modulating the effect of C/EBP, and that the formation of USF isoforms may be regulated by cAMP in Sertoli cells.</s>
