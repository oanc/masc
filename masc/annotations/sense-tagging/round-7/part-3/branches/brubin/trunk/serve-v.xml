A soluble form of FasL has been described, but appears to be less capable of inducing apoptosis, when compared with the bound form [ 10 11 ] . The binding of FasL with Fas initiates receptor oligomerization, which recruits Fas-associated death domain (FADD) [ 12 ] . FADD binds procaspase-8 and permits activation of caspase-8 through self-cleavage [ 13 ] . Caspase-8 activates the effector caspases, which commits the cell to the orderly process of apoptosis [ 14 15 ] . In addition, caspase-8 cleaves Bcl-2-interactive-death-agonist (Bid) [ 16 ] . Truncated Bid localizes to the mitochondria and promotes cytochrome c release; this process also serves as a major apoptotic-signaling pathway for Fas [ 16 17 18 ] . Depending upon the amount of caspase-8 that is activated, the predominant pathway can be either Bid cleavage with subsequent mitochondrial release of cytochrome c or activation of the effector caspase pathway [ 18 ] . Resident cells of the kidney express both Fas and FasL and Fas/FasL signaling is functional in these cells [ 19 20 21 22 23 24 ] . A recent review by Ortiz and associates [ 25 ] noted that the combined literature demonstrating participation of Fas/FasL pathway in renal injury essentially fulfilled Koch's postulates.</s>
