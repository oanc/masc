Interestingly, the related RGE ligand-binding motif [ 41 ] occurs in a conserved region of the midasin AAA-domain (yeast, residues 1835-1838), as well as in the AAA-domain of Mg chelatases [ 32 ] . The presence of this consensus binding motif in the AAA domain raises the possibility of the midasin molecule folding back onto itself, with the M-domain becoming attached to one face of the AAA domain and perhaps regulating access to its central chamber, in a manner analogous to that in which the 19S proteasome regulator, also an AAA protein, controls access to the central proteolytic chamber of the proteasome [ 42 ] .</s>

This leads to the switching of the RdRP to the &quot;replication mode&quot;, resulting in the synthesis of full-length, encapsidated anti-genomic RNA, which is in turn replicated into more genomic RNA [ 15 ] . Thus, the very requirement of N for replication ensures that all full-length genomic and antigenomic RNA are wrapped with N protein, i.e., encapsidated [ 15 ] . The new pool of replicated genomic RNA serves as templates for secondary transcription.</s>
