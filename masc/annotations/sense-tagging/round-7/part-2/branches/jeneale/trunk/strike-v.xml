The title refers to two Salt Lake City punks whose tentative attempts at rebellion are more funny and halfhearted than seriously anarchistic: It's &quot;an absurdist coming-of-age comedy&quot; that's &quot;better defined by its polish than by punk trappings&quot; (Maslin, New York Times ). Some are not impressed with the film's watered down rebellion: &quot;[T]his energetic but poorly structured, rather self-congratulatory look at spike-haired rebelliousness in mid-'80s Utah could strike unbiased viewers as more grating than gratifying,&quot; and the film &quot;doesn't quite grasp how its slick, flashy package undermines any actual punk cred&quot; it might have (Dennis Harvey, Variety ). (Brush up on your own punk cred by seeing how many of these bands you know.)</s>
