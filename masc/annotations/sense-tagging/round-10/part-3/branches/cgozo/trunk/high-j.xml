The formation constants for Co, Cu, and Fe complexes of pdtc were determined to be greater than 10 33 [ 3 ] . Uptake studies using 59Fe showed that addition of pdtc to the growth medium of two different pdtc-producing pseudomonads increased the efficiency of iron uptake by 20% [ 1 ] . The contribution of pdtc to iron uptake may be due to the fact that the copper complex of pdtc (Cu:pdtc) has the ability to reduce both soluble and mineral forms of ferric iron) [ 1 ] .
