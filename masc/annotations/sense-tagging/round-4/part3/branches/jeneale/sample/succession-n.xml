In a recent report [ 12 ] we have shown that, for genomic sequences, Markov tables are in fact a special case of CGR, contrary to what had been suggested previously [ 13 ] . This raised the prospect of an advantageous use of iterative maps as state spaces not only for representation of sequences but also to identify scale independent stochastic models of the &lt;b&gt;succession&lt;/b&gt; scheme.</s>
