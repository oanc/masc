Previously in our laboratory, we cloned the cDNA encoding proHB-EGF from monkey Vero cells and identified this cell-surface molecule as a receptor for diphtheria toxin (DT) [ 2 ] . The predicted amino acid sequence was shown to be identical to that of the cell surface-expressed precursor of human heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (proHB-EGF) [ 3 4 ] . The derived amino acid sequence revealed a signal sequence (residues 1-23), an extracellular domain (residues 24-159), a transmembrane domain (residues 160-184), and a carboxyl terminal cytoplasmic domain (residues 185-208) [ 2 ] . Proteolytic processing of the proHB-EGF occurs on the cell surface and results in the release of &lt;b&gt;mature&lt;/b&gt; HB-EGF (mHB-EGF) (residues 63-148) [ 5 ] . The &lt;b&gt;mature&lt;/b&gt;/soluble HB-EGF is a member of the EGF family of growth factors that includes amphiregulin, epidermal growth factor, and transforming growth factor a [ 6 ] . Mature HB-EGF released from the cell surface is mitogenic and is able to bind to the EGF receptor [ 3 ] . Membrane-bound proHB-EGF has juxtacrine growth factor activity [ 7 ] and also acts as a DT receptor [ 2 8 ] .</s>
