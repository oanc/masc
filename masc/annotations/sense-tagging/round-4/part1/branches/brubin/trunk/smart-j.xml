Critics say this one is better because Grisham goes beyond his usual dabbling in social causes and injects honest-to-God Christian spirituality, and with &lt;b&gt;success&lt;/b&gt;: &quot;Grisham's &lt;b&gt;smart&lt;/b&gt; use of the suspense novel to explore questions of being and faith puts him squarely in the footsteps of Dickens and Graham Greene&quot; ( Publishers Weekly ). A few reviewers find the overt Christianity preachy and self-righteous, but most say it improves an otherwise standard page-turner.</s>
