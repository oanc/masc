Recent investigations demonstrate that VEGF increases vascular permeability [ 4 ] , endothelial cell proliferation in vitro [ 8 ] , and angiogenesis in vivo [ 9 ] . We have previously demonstrated that VEGF mRNA is upregulated in rat gastrocnemius muscle following 1 hour of acute submaximal treadmill &lt;b&gt;exercise&lt;/b&gt; [ 10 ] , in dog gastrocnemius muscle following 1 hour of electrical stimulation [ 11 ] , and in human vastus lateralis following 30 min of one-legged knee extension &lt;b&gt;exercise&lt;/b&gt; at 50% maximal capacity [ 12 ] . Other studies show similar upregulation of VEGF mRNA in chronically electrically stimulated rat skeletal muscle [ 13 14 ] , and in human vastus lateralis following 45 min of one-legged knee extension &lt;b&gt;exercise&lt;/b&gt; [ 15 ] .</s>
