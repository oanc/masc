However, DNA methylation of promoters, more easily aligned with transcriptional silencing, can be RNA mediated if suitable double stranded RNA versions of the promoter sequence are transcribed, either fortuitously or by design [ 36 37 38 39 40 ] . Therefore, there may be a natural tendency for PTGS loci to &lt;b&gt;mature&lt;/b&gt; to TGS and associated trans-silencing, which in turn could prove problematic in applying PTGS in commercial plant breeding programs.</s>
