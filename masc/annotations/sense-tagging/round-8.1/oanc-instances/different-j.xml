The metallo-β-lactamases have been further divided by Bush into subgroups based on amino acid sequence identity: the Ba enzymes share a &gt;23% sequence identity, require 2 Zn(II) ions for full activity, prefer penicillins and cephalosporins as substrates, and are represented by metallo-β-lactamase CcrA from Bacteroides fragilis, the Bb enzymes share a 11% sequence identity with the Ba enzymes, require only 1 Zn(II) ion for full activity, prefer carbapenems as substrates, and are represented by the metallo-β-lactamase imiS from Aeromonas sobria, and the Bc enzymes have only 9 conserved residues with the other metallo-β-lactamases, require 2 Zn(II) ions for activity, contain a different metal binding motif than the other metallo-β-lactamases, prefer penicillins as substrates, and are represented by the metallo-β-lactamase L1 from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia [ 9 ] . A similar grouping scheme (B1, B2, and B3) based on structural properties of the metallo-β-lactamases has recently been offered [ 41 ] . The diversity of the group 3 β-lactamases is best exemplified by the enzymes' vastly differing efficacies towards non-clinical inhibitors; these differences predict that one inhibitor may not inhibit all metallo-β-lactamases [ 18 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 ] .

However, the targeting mechanism and the regulation involved in these two cases of Smad1 degradation by proteasome are likely fundamentally different [ 39 ] . The second functional outcome of the physical link between Smad1, HsN3 and Az is the ability of Smad1 to regulate the proteasomal degradation of SNIP1, which is clearly dependent upon high levels of Smad1, Az and a strong activation signal from the type I receptor, as suggested by the observations that the protein levels of Smad1, Az and ALK3Q233D directly influence the degree of SNIP1 degradation.</s>

A theoretical analysis of the kinetics of DNA hybridization demonstrated that diffusion was important in determining the time of required to reach equilibrium and was proportional to the equilibrium binding constant and to the concentration of binding sites [ 20 ] . A recent theoretical and experimental analysis of competitive hybridization in a two-color system demonstrated the need for the hybridization kinetics of the two probes to be the same [ 21 ] . An elegant study on the use of hybridization kinetics to differentiate specific from non-specific binding was recently published [ 22 ] .

Vertical, or wall, surface area is thought to be the source of artifacts in micro- and mesocosm experiments that are scaled down from actual habitat size and artificially enclose the system in question [ 3 ] . Wall area is an artifact, because as microcosms are scaled down wall area per unit volume increases, which may affect composition of the microbial community and increase dominance of periphyton [ 3 ] .
