Rum1p is a Sic1p-analogous CDK inhibitor, which accumulates in G1, but is degraded as cells enter S phase [ 21 22 ] . Failure to degrade Rum1p is the major phenotypic defect of pop1 and pop2 deletion strains, which leads to disturbance of normal cell cycle progression, resulting in polyploidy [ 18 19 20 23 ] . Based on the genetic data and the biochemical observation that Pop1p and Pop2p interact when overexpressed, a putative SCF Pop1p-Pop2pcomplex was proposed, which would contain the heterooligomerizing F-box proteins Pop1p and Pop2p bound to SCF core components [ 18 20 ] .</s>
