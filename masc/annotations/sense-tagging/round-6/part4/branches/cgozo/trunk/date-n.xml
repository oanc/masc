Positional mapping of the STSL locus to human chromosome 2p21 led to the identification of two genes, ATP binding cassette (ABC) half-transporters G5 and G8 that were mutated in affected individuals [ 8 9 10 11 12 ] . The protein products of these two genes (sterolin-1 and sterolin-2 respectively) are thought to form heterodimers to constitute a functional transporter, based primarily on the genetic evidence that affected individuals are either completely mutated in sterolin-1 or sterolin-2, but not both [ 12 ] . More recently, evidence from in vitro expression of these proteins has been presented that these two proteins co-immunoprecipitate, supporting this conclusion [ 13 ] . ABCG5 and ABCG8 appear to be present in all mammalian genomes examined to &lt;b&gt;date&lt;/b&gt; and are highly conserved between species, indicating that these genes may have a similar function in other species.</s>
