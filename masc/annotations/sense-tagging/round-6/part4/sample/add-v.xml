Levels of N-3 fatty acids vary by fish species, oil content of fish, sex and age of fish, and factors exogenous to fish such as water temperature [ 47 48 ] . Oily fish from cold waters (whether marine or fresh bodies of water) are reported to have higher levels of N-3 fatty acids in comparison to fish from warmer bodies [ 45 47 ] . The ratio of N-3 to N-6 fatty acids has recently been suggested as being associated with gestation and birth weight [ 49 ] and this ratio is approximately four-times greater in marine fish in comparison to fresh water fish [ 45 ] . Type and species-specific fish consumption will remain important considerations in assessing exposure scenarios based on fish consumption.</s>
