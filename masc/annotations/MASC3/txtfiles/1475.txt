“Madison?” “MADISON, you’re staring again” Jenny said. I blinked a few times and turned to look at her.“What?” “You were staring at Jayden again” she repeated. “Sorry.” I told her looking towards his locker again, he was gone.“If you want to talk to him just run into him.” “What?” I asked“Run into him in the hallway and drop your books, it’s sure to start a converstation, always does. Trust me.” she explained.“Um I don’t really think that will work Jenny” I told her“Ok whatever” she replied as she went into her 6th period class. I headed off to my bio class. I love bio. Well actually I hate bio the only reason I like it is because he’s in my class. By “he” I’m referring to Jayden Stewart. I don’t know why I like him. He’s just different. A good different. He plays three different sports; soccer, basketball, and lacrosse. He doesn’t act like the jock type though. I don’t know just what it is, but i know he’s different

The air is suprisingly crisp as we walk along the path around the garden. We walk side by side in scilence for a while, only the shuffle of my skirts against the ground can be heard.“The leaves are quite beautiful” He says suddenly. I turn to him and study his still face. Then slowly I glance at the turring leaves, he’s right they give off colorful tints of reds and oranges. More scilence.“My fiance’, Willow” I settle my eyes back on him. He continues.”She has rejected me, a month before the wedding”. He turns and meets my eyes.”Her words were that she didn’t deserve me, and that some other loved me much much more.” I remain silent and conscentrate on the ground.“That is most unfortunate Mr. Hayes” I manage to rasp. We approah a tall thick cedar tree. He stops and leans against it, his eyes search my exspression. I keep my face still and unreadable.“Is it Evy?” I nearly flinch at the use of his nickname for myself. He slowly lifts his hand and strokes my cheek, and I find I can’t move away,

I walked into my bio class and sat down in my seat. A few seconds later he came and sat down in his seat. Did I mention his seat is right next to mine. OUr seats have been next to each other all year and not once did we have a converstation. Sure he always said Hi Madison every morning and I said hi back, but no actual converstation. Oh well. Class went by quickly and I rushed out the door as soon as the bell rang. I had to meet Jenny and her locker. I saw him walking off towards his locker when something came across my mind. Just run into him and drop your books that’s what Jenny had said, but did it actually work. It sounded so stupid. I was contenplating to myself wether or not to try it when Jenny came running up.“Are you ready?” she asked.“Yeah, lets go” I replied. We were going to go out to dinner with friends then go to the soccer game. We all piled in Jenny’s car and went to hang out at my house until dinner.

“When angels fall to earth, no one notices.” I stare at my grandma with all her soft wrinkles and twinkly eyes.“Are you an angel grandma?” “Oh no of course not child.” “Are you sure?” She smiles and nods her head
The sun is warm on my back, the sand soft in between my splayed fingers. I sigh and listen to the waves crash over and over. That had been nearly six years earlier, the last time I had seen my grandmother since her death when I was 8. That’s also when my mother had wanted me. When her boyfriend never took a liking to me I went to my aun’t house. She never came around after that. I didn’t mind my aunt. She was kind and let me have my childhood, but still it wasn’t the same as a real mom. I had belived in my grandmother when she spoke of angels. For years I had kept my eye out for one. But I never did find one, I gave up after my 12th birthday.

Drowning in your liesWhy is it the only things you dared to share?
Split in twoThere’s a red line between black and white
You never meant the words you spokeWhat was the point of saying them at all?
Ignorance is BlissFrustration along Silence
So I Shut my eyesAnd the world dies down
You penetrate through my impartial eyesAnd you whisper in my faceThose venomous words which lure me back into your game

“Elli!” I hissed. “What are you doing? What just happened?” So my assumptions were right. This was not going to be easy…I looked up at Griffin, expecting him to back me up, but he kept silent, a look of pure disbelief evident on his face. I elbowed him.“How long have you known?”he asked quietly, and Elli smiled sheepishly. “About a month,” she said. Oh, God, she’d been like this for a month! Anything could have happened….“What?!” Griffin bellowed. I shushed him, not wanting to attract attention to an already suspicious situation.“Did you say anything? To anyone at all?” I asked, trying to stay calm. Elli just shook her head. Good. That was good.“A month,” Griffin said. “So by now you know what you can do. Right?” She nodded. “Well? Are you going to tell us?” I said impatiently.“Okay,” she whispered. “I can turn invisible if I’m really still for awhile. And I can become a shadow. I can attatch myself to other people’s shadow. I’ve been your shadow a couple times.”

They left me. Alone. With him.
Under the only dangling light bulb, my eyes were stuck on my executioner’s monster smile as he studied me with his quick moving eyes. Before I could muster the courage to say anything, his combat boots were walking my way, very slowly.
When he finally reached the chair that held me prisoner, he gently touched my hair and went, “Tsk, tsk.” I started shaking my head fiercely. He put his hand on top of my head and held it in place sternly. “Don’t worry. Just calm down.” His voice was hypnotizing. “It won’t hurt a bit.” He licked his knife and smiled wide enough to show some of his shark-like teeth. His knife moved instantly. I screamed. It was horrendous.
There was a silence.
My eyes flew open when I realized I wasn’t dead. My appointed killer stood in front of me. Then, my ears heard a rustling coming from outside. Slowly, it faded away. When I focused my attention back to the boy, I found sadness.
Speaking softly, he told me the most shocking thing.
“I’m your brother.”

Run don’t walk
I want to reach the feeling soon
The feeling that makes your fingertips tingle
The feeling that makes your heart feel constricted
But with the feeling of anticipation
Of the following events
Hand in hand we turn away from this skeptical world
fingers intwined, we run away
Away from daylight to our clandestine
You be the question, my lips will be the answer

“What do you mean you’ve been my shadow?” I asked, confused. Then reality and realization kicked in at the same time. I took a step toward her, and she took a step back. “Are you saying you know about-”  “Yes.” she said simply. “I know you two are secretly together. Don’t worry I won’t tell!” Ugh. This was a disaster.“Now, are you going to let me finish telling you about my…powers, or whatever you want to call them?” Griffin and I just waited. “I have wings!” she said proudly. “Is that it?” Griffin asked. “Yes…”  “We  ALL  have wings, you idiot!” he was raising his voice now. “Shh!!!” I looked at the houses surrounding us. Luckily I didn’t see anyone looking curiously out their window. “Look,” he said, softly this time. “You’re not as free as you think you are. Our power is not for pranks. We’re not here to go around doing whatever we please. You’re the new kid now,” he looked over at me and watched the smile spread across my face as I realized what he had just said.

“There are rules you’re gonna have to learn. And  FOLLOW .” Griffin told Elli, but I wasn’t listening. Elli was the new New Kid. Which means I wasn’t the new kid anymore. At long last, too. I had been the new kid for seven long years. Subject to teasing and taunting beyond imagination simply because there were no new kids to pick on…. Seven long years.“For now, go home.” I heard Griffin say, and Elli started to walk away.“Let’s take a walk. Talk to the trees,” I suggested. I knew Griffin was never at ease among our brethren, but he’d have to get used to it. He was our new leader now.“Fine,” he sighed, so we rean into the forest. Ran until we could no longer see the sunlight filtering through the trees. “Ready?” I asked, although it wasn’t really a question. “As I’ll ever be,” he replied. He turned toward me and smiled. I stood up on my toes and our lips met for a brief moment. Then he took my hand, and I smiled as we spread our wings, and launched ourselves up toward the canopy.

I decided to text my mom, I had 16 texts waiting for me, 7 from my parents.
The message basically was, "Where the hell are you? If your out there..well you know,then we're disowning you"?
I texted my parents back saying I was at the hospital with a really close friend and I forgot to tell them..they couldn't know who Aydan was, they'd massacre me..they'd belive me..hopefully
They texted me back saying I was grounded for 2 months when I got home, and I didn’t argue.
Thats when Bailey started texting me

It was an idiotic accident. An idiotic accident due to the stupid,retarded behavior of me and my friends during the middle of the night. We decided to meet in the middle of the street so that there wouldn’t be any obstacles in the way.“You guys ready?”I whispered. I got a chorus of yeahs,yesses and duhs.“Alright. Let’s do this.” Bud told us. We had  GIGANTIC  potfuls of Diet Coke lined all the way to the end of the block. Lola,the tomboy in our group,was giggling and snickering while taking out the 100 packs of mentoes that we had bought. Of course,we hadn’t bought them all at once,that would be  WAY  to suspicious. Soon,we were  ALL  guffawing and snorting with Lola. She put 10 into each of our hands and on three,we released them into the pots. There was a large boom and coketoes geysers erupted from all the pots. Since we made the mistake of having the pots near the houses,foaming fizz fell in front,and some,on,them. We laughed ‘til we fell over,but smiled sheepishly when adults started to come out of their houses.

Working more at odds than in concert with the maid’s careful efforts, Miriam attempted to correct her daughter’s disheveled state. This just wouldn’t do, as the child’s father would be home soon.
“Oh, Sariah, you silly child. You gave us such a fright! I was nearly out of my mind with worry.” She failed entirely to see the servant roll her eyes. Instead, her mind drifted, backing once again away from reality.
“Course, I remember being young, headstrong and full of dreams…such lovely dreams.” Her tone turned whistful, “But dreams won’t sustain you forever, child. Heh, forever child. What a funny turn of phrase…such a lovely thought.”
Once rolled eyes now narrowed with a little concern, but Mrs. Montefort snapped back for a moment, “Why am I blathering? We must hurry. Your father will be home soon…your father…”
And with that she was gone again, mincing down the hall muttering, ”...home soon.”
She was off to make herself presentable.
Beautiful.

“Make up my mind,” I muttered bitterly. Jas just laughed and watched me go back into the changing room. I had been trying on dresses for an hour now and she just told me to go and try on a dress I had tried on fourty-five minutes ago. I took off the green strapless, definitely not for me, and pulled on a blue one with sleeves. Much better.
“Now that’s way better than the other one. I don’t know what we were thinking.” I rolled my eyes. We. I had no clue what I was doing. I wouldn’t even be going to the dance if it hadn’t been for Jas. She forced me. I swear. Actually, she just kept saying that something out of this world was going to happen. I admit, my curiousity had been peaked. After we finally agreed on the blue dress and I payed for it we continued to walk through the mall.
“Hey, girls.”
“Hey!” Jas kissed her Kyle, her boyfriend, and I walked over to a bench down the hall. When they got going, it was best to be far away. It was sorta nice to be alone anyway.

This brought back bad memories when dad was here at the same hospital. but this time I didn’t want the patient to live. Even if it made my mom sad.
Be carefulwhat you wish for the saying goes. Just then Bretts’ monitor went off with a resounding beeeep and he was flatlining. Mom and I were quickly usherd from the room as the doctor and nurses worked on my moms boyfriend.
When the doctor came out I knew what he was going to say,“I’m sorry Mrs. Brizelli,” but that’s all mom heard when she went into fits of crying.
In my foolishness I thought Brett’s death was the end of my troubles. But now the police might find out it was Sam would he fought with and Sam would be charged with murder.
I had to see to it that the police never suspected Sam. And I had to get rid of the tape I made of what Brett did to me, as that was the motive.

My friends and I shoved our way through the door of Paul’s Pizza Palace. We always tried to get through the door with 6 people at once. We all sat in our red booth. The waitress smiled at us,”the usual?” “Yeah.” I said without listening to anyone else’s opinion.“Wait!”Mary said just as the waitress’s pen touched the pad.”Umm. What’s this?”Mary questioned,shoving the menu in her face.“Oh,that’s just our featured pizza for this month.” I personally thought that was a long time for a featured pizza.“I’ll have one of those.”Mary stated. Then the waitress jotted it down and the pizzas came. There was the regular: half cheese,half pepperoni. Then there was….Whatever Mary ordered. It smelled like dead fish stuffed in turkey guts,put together in a blender then put on crust,sauce and cheese and called pizza by unamed individuals. She dared me to try 1 slice. I did and I thought I was gonna hurl. It tasted  EXACTLY  how it smelled. Later Mary told me that it was fish-filled haggis!That was the last time I ate pizza.

Even though the dwarf’s leather jacket, leather pants and leather boots were slightly dusty and threadbare, he nevertheless stood proudly tall, which is not an easy thing to do if you are 9.123 hands short. He sucked in his breath to make him even taller, but that just made his mithril chain mail clink and uncomfortably loose, so he stopped and just breathed normally. His hands trembled ever so slightly and thoughtlessly he groped for his axe until he realised that he did not have it with him.
In contrast, the tall elf who stood next to him wore flowing robes that seemed to have been spun from sunbeams and spider silk. The gemstones glittered like dewdrops as the crystal clear morning light caught and caressed them. She stood very still and her gossamer veiled face did not betray her emotions, but those who knew her intimately could see a nervous shiver.

Once upon a time, there was a creature so rare that it knew kungfu! But not just any creature, this happened to be a queen! ‘Queen FuFu’, as she was so fondly called by her subjects, was scaley from her terrible psoriases. Queen FuFu was a bit crazy… At night she would spaz out by hopping on one foot and twitching, then every 23 minutes…  EXACTLY , she would scream, “I  LOVE LAKROOLABOONNA !” Her subjects loved her even when she flapped her imaginary wings in their faces; everyone in her castle sneezed non-stop because of the imaginary feathers up their nostrils. And being that allergy medicine was illegal, all her subjects resulted in wiping whatever was dripping or dropping from their body cavities on the person the the right of them. There were to never, Never,  NEVER  wipe it on the person to the left of them, for it had the penalty of death, if they dared. But not just any death. First, they were to be stripped of their manditory peacock costumes and barbed in pressed sheets of llama dung.

WHile she was ranting and raving she decided that the blade of booties should be made into their national weapon. “HUZZAH!” She exclaimed wile finding a bat in the cave… (If you know what I mean…) Nudges person next to you while winkingNo one would ever know, well until that fateful day, that if you mix cocoa powder with her blade of booties, that it becomes a quite powerful bomb….a bomb so strong that it blew up….. a blade of grass. Her subjects were so overwhelmed by joy, they had …Pink hearts, yellow moons, orange stars, green clovers. Hearts, stars, and horseshoes. Clovers and blue moons. Pots of gold and rainbows. And me red balloons… in their eyes, that they had found this valuable weapon of  MINIMAL DESTRUCTION !!

Sequels: none


The next day, Queen FuFu (being blind) tripped over a dead squrriel onto the patch of scorched rocks where the lonely blad of grass used to grow, and cracked open her skull. Everyone started laughing, for they thought the whole incident was immensly funny. So they took video recording deviced and then put the videos on youtube for all to see… And can you believe, they got over a hundred million hits… Just five hots under “Quarter Indian” video. Queen FuFu now resides with chipmunks, who slowly and deliberately eat her flesh, they  LOVE  live flesh.. (Eye twitch o. O)
And the chipmunks lived heavily Ever After
(And became uncannily fat, with obese tongues. So much so, that it interfered with their marital relations… you know… in the wood shavings with their meatballs and stolen pizza from Little Caesar’s. And you can’t forget the  CHEEZY BREAD ! (You are like a breadstick….you got no rhythm!) )
The End…

Sequels: 48263


The atmosphere around my house was very sad and depressing. Part of me was happy that there was no loud mouth Brett around. But at the same time, my family was suffering and in distress for the exact same reason – his demise. He was a vegetable now, according to the doctors. Mom wouldn’t let them take Brett off of the machines, because she said that we should never give up hope. We didn’t have a funeral for him,but my mother had gone into Brett’s room for one last time to say goodbye. She asked me if I wanted to,just in case there was anything I had left to say to him. I could think of some things. But I knew being a Christian boy it wouldn’t be right for me to say them out loud to anyone, much less a dying man in the hospital. I wondered if God would forgive me for the way I reacted to Brett’s death, in addition to being gay. I also hoped that He could somehow forgive Sam for what he did, because it was to defend me from my mom’s abusive boyfriend. Finally, in my heart, I hoped that Brett would be forgiven too.
