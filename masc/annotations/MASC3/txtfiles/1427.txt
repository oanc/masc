This rope feels snug around my neck. 
I will take one step towards heavenThen take one short fall towards hell. I will stop midway, and my fate will be chosen. 
I breathe slowly. Thinking life over. I bow my head to GodAnd state a prayer
I read the clock 9:40I close my eyesI take a step towards happiness. This rope feels snug around my neck.

I never really talked to Dan; the other voice on the phone just kept chattering annoyingly.. “We’ll send you a letter once he hears about you.”
“Okay. thanks. bye.” The words were my typical ending to a phone call.
So Bigshot couldn’t talk to little old me? I didn’t make a deal out of it. The letter would explain it all.
I hoped it would.
I hoped it wasn’t a scam.
How many people are asked to be in a movie? That sort of thing doesn’t happen every day, you know..
And why me?
Had I done something to impress this Dan Stringer? For that matter, was the card number he’d given me just a fake, a joke? Why had he even noticed me in the first place? All I could remember doing was having two, three… maybe six drinks at most. But I’d only had three, I think, before talking to him.
Okay, so I don’t remember much from that day.
But I had a lot of questions.
One that lingered in my mind the most was the one that would answer most others.
Why me?

Stars glimmering dimly, through broken treesentice me silently into a world of dreamingWhispers of reality slowly fade behindan encompassing shadow of surrealityYour voice echoes through the wallsimagination’s path well worn, familiaras time flashes light, your name is all I hearIn love’s garden, serenity reigning beautyMetaphorically speaking, is all I knowTommorow is just a day, and dreaming is my nowHere, from balconies soar, wingless creativity Fantasy’s beloved sky of broken star beamsDistractions inspire those who unnoticed sparklebrilliantly cloaked in colors of stunning beauty,Winged myths that the blind deem seemingly ordinary. In forests of night where dreams take runninginner voices that inside are screaming truthWhispers of reality, slivers of each passing dayrelay your call, that my soul responds instinctivelyThe sun rises slowly, night relinquishing its wings to search for that call, where that voice once sings

“Mhmm.” I blushed, turning away.
Why was I so nervous around this guy? I hardly knew him; the only thing that I did know about him was that he was kind of cute.
Usually, it took me a while to like somebody, really like somebody, not just a couple of minutes… but on my first day? It was so odd. I didn’t like him, and I wouldn’t like him.
End of that.
Going back to my drawing, I saw Parker doing the same.
I averted my eyes back to my paper, catching a glance of Parker’s work on the way.
Though he didn’t have much done, I noticed something that I’d seen before. Leaning in closer, I ignored Parker’s questioning gaze.
“What is it? What’s wrong?” He stopped shading, staring at me.
“It’s… he…” I looked up at his eyes, and he looked back, still concerned. “Nothing… it’s just really good.”
“Thanks.” He went back to the drawing, laughing a little.
The picture, even in the first stages of the sketch, was already recognizeable to me. It was the man from my nightmares.

I miss you. You might not believe it, or think it possible but I do.
I miss you. I miss your smile. Your laugh. Your arms wrapped around me tight. The way your face lights up when you solve a problem. The feel of your lips on mine.
I miss you. When do I get to see you again? How long must I wait? A day? A week? A month? How long?
I miss you. I miss you and its driving me crazy. All I think about is you. All I care about is you. All I want to do is spend time with you. But does that happen? No.
I miss you. It always seems that we always just barely miss eachother. If I had done this, or you had done that, then we would’ve had some time together. Even if it was only a few minutes. That would’ve been enough for me.
I miss you. I really just do.

Later, Darren told me what he could do. He, in a sense, had photographic memory, but in an extremely powerful way. Anything he'd ever experienced was embedded into his mind- he told me he even remembered being born, which was pretty gross. I didn’t believe him.
Others were more interesting. The two girls, Lucy and Julia, were both connected. They said that Lucy could listen to thoughts, while Julia could put thoughts or images into someone's mind. Only Julia could control when to use her power; Lucy was always listening, she couldn't turn it off.
Most other people stayed away from me. The whole "˜blind' thing really set me apart.
Theo kept waking up the same way he did that day for the rest of the ride, and his headaches got worse every day until I told him to use his powers.
"There's not enough room,"? he'd said.
"Do you really need that much space?"?
"Well, I guess not, but-"
"Just do it."?
He sighed, then his feet left the ground. He stopped having headaches after that.

The rest of the week went by slowly. The only things I did was eat sleep, talk to Theo, and listen to music. I was bored, more bored than I'd ever been. At least Dr. Karon wasn't near me for the rest of the ride.
On the last day on the ship, a voice announced, "We'll be landing in two hours."?
Then, everything became hectic.
People ran through the halls, ecstatic with the news. I felt as if I was the only one who wasn't excited.
I was dreading the moment we would land. What would it be like? So many things would be different, so strange"¦
Two hours. Two hours from now, I would be stuck on Earth. I wouldn't return home, I knew that much.
The ship was a bit shaky now, probably just slowing down from the faster speed it'd been going. "One hour until landing,"? the fuzzy voice said.
I was roaming about the hallways in a daze. 60 minutes, and then"¦ Earth.

Back on my planet, when I'd gone to school, they'd taught us about the planet, how disgusting and wild Earth really was. The pollution level was off the charts, they'd said.
The people living on earth were mutants; all the toxic chemicals changed them. Of course, I was always asked by other people if I'd come from Earth.
On my planet, that was a bit of an insult.
Evem then, though, I had a feeling the rumors about Earth couldn't be true, as much as I'd accepted and wanted to accept them at the moment. Why would they be taking people, children, who needed "treatment"? to a place so horrible as the Earth they'd told us about?
"Thirty minutes. Report to your bedrooms immediately."?
I walked into my room, still quiet despite the nonstop sounds in the hallway, and sat on my bed.
A heavy rumble was sent through the entire ship, lasting for a minute or two.
"Ten minutes."?
Here it comes. I braced myself for it.
"Three minutes."?
Oh, God, I wasn't ready for Earth!
"Thirty seconds!"?

I squeezed my eyes shut, which didn't make a difference, clenched my teeth, and waited for the landing. A huge jerk went through the room, throwing me back.
"Gather your things and report to the meeting room,"? the voice said.
Since I'd never even brought anything, I went to Theo's room and waited for him to pack. He didn't have very much, but he wanted to wait for Darren too, and Darren wasn't the lightest packer.
Once he had all of his things together, the three of us went to the room with everyone else.
"Regan, you come with me."? Doctor Karon pulled me out of the crowd, Theo following. "Theodore, stay with the other passengers."?
"No. I'm staying with her."?
"You can't do this."?
"Yes, and I am. Let me go with you, or let her stay with me. Pick."?
Theo was the boss right now. Dr. Karon, for some unknown reason to me, was afraid of him.
Though there were some reasons to be afraid of him, I would never be scared of Theo. At least I understood what he'd said to me earlier.

"Just come with us"¦ I have something I need to tell both of you anyway."?
We left the room, no one noticing our absence. "Watch your step,"? Karon said, opening a thick door.
A huge vaccuming sound came from the wall, and Theo said, “Stairs.”
I stepped out onto the platform that led to the stairs. It'd all folded out of the wall. Once outside, the sun hit my face, and a breeze blew through my hair, making it swirl around my head.
My teachers always said that  EVERYTHING  was polluted on Earth; this was the freshest air I'd ever breathed!
Reaching the ground, Doctor Karon led us to a car nearby. We all got into the back seat, Karon in the middle. "Put these on,"? he said, handing us both a pair of handcuffs. "It's new regulation"¦ don't try anything, Regan."?
"I won't."? I closed the metal bracelets around each wrist, Theo doing the same. "What is it you needed to tell us?"?
"Well, you two may have noticed a connection"¦ there is a connection both of you, a close one."?

I never chose to be the one, the one who leads the crowd. The one who picks up the beaten, the lonely, the tortured and brings them onward. There have been in many cases where my life nearly came to it’s end. I moved on, life will move on. Some people dislike me because of what I stand for. Some hate me because of who I stand up for. I simply say, you can’t stop me, you won’t stop me and just when you think you can, i’ll be one step ahead. I have my flaws and have no problem admiting that. I walk like no one is looking, but I make sure everyone is looking. I’ve taken beatings for people just because I knew that person didn’t deserve it and would get it worse. I’m not afraid to tell you to your face, your wrong or tell you, that your not fair. I just wait for the day where I will lead the lonely, the beaten, the tortured and the depressed. I will lead with so many others over the people who always put us down. I live by this one saying. Loved by few, Hated by most, Respected By All.
I Am Robert.

Nine years ago you stole my heart. You swept me away and made me believe in true love. It was then I experienced the exquisite taste of first love. The excitement and the exhilaration that comes from experiencing a powerful emotion for the very first time.  Nine years ago we were young and impressionable. Our lives set out in front of us like an expansive map. Our destiny was ours for the taking. Who knows what the future would hold.
Our lives took us places we never expected or imagined. We respectively learned things along the way. Lessons had to be learned, experiences had to be experienced. Life had lead us down separate paths.
Nine years later we find our paths have merged. At an instant it’s like time stood still. For a moment everything feels like its in place. Time did us a favor by teaching us lessons. It taught us that we were meant to be together. The world seems to suddenly make sense. Destiny is smiling with pride. We are meant to be

It’s a slow and steady thing that builds up inside you,until its about to burst into this brilliant beautiful spectacle much like what we see here. These bright colors and crisp wind is like that feeling of clarity when you realize that your in love.

After I got off of the phone with Chris, I screamed! ‘Cause I was extatic! He is sooo amazing! I guess dreams can come true right?!
Well, the next day at school wasn’t all that great…
“Hey Claire!” I heard a voice say behind my locker. Wonder who that could be. Tee hee. “Hey you.” I said. I hope i wasn’t getting too nervous. Just after I said that a girl came up to Chris’ side. It was the popular “skank” (that’s what i thought of her ‘cause she was in love with Chris) Chrissy Barter. “Hey Chrissy Bear.” she said. Skank. “Oh, hey Chrissy.” he said. “Chris I was wondering if you’d like to come over to my house Saturday and we could do something fun.” she said in a flirty kind of way. “Well, I’m sorry Chrissy I’ve already made plans.” he said, and threw a little grin at me. “Oh.” she said. Good that done pissed her off. Serves her right. “Well, maybe I’ll catch you next week.” she said. As she started to leave she came up to my ear and said, “Watch your back bitch.” Whatever.

I think I’ll always remember the day that Stallion came to us. They called him Macintosh, or Mac for short, because when they caught him, they saw him jump up high into the air just to reach a big, red Macintosh apple.
I didn’t like calling him Mac, for two reasons. Mac didn’t suit him. It just didn’t. I couldn’t explain it, but the horse seemed to give off a royal air to him. The name Mac was so… tame. The other reason was this: he didn’t belong to us. He didn’t belong to anybody. Stallion seemed the perfect name. It was generalizing, but could be used as a name never the less.
Like what Pocahontas says. You can’t own the earth. This horse was like the earth. He was the wind and the rain and the sky. He was the marvelous storm that shook even the oldest, most deeply rooted trees. He was the sun peeking out from under the clouds, and the double rainbows. He was the pot of gold under the mysterious swirling colors.
He was wild. He was free.
But not for long.

Okay, so I challenge you to do something fairly simple – write a brief autobiography about yourself.
It can consist of a few paragraphs about you, memorable experiences you’ve had, or even a poem about you.
If you don’t want to give out any personal info, then that is understandable.
After all, it is extremely important to say safe online!
But if you can, just write anything about you.
It can be anything from the color socks you like to wear to your favorite food to your hobbies.
Just write about the thing you know about the most….  YOU !!!!!

Both hearts had stopped. There was no intake of air. There was only silence between them. The only sounds that could be heard was the chatter of people trying to figure out what they were doing this afternoon. That and Lucy’s panting. The suspense was really getting to her.
Janice couldn’t believe it. She had longed to hear those words for so long, she couldn’t trust her ears. She was having trouble deciding whether it was really happening or if it was another of her many daydreams. The thing that made her realize it was real was the look on Kyle’s face. Never could she have imagined that look of shear terror mixed with absolute horror and a dash of hope.
 ANSWER HIM !!! The voice was going crazy,  JUST SAY YES ALREADY !!!  COME ON !!!!! Janice wanted to but she couldn’t find the words. She stood there gaping, her jaw inches from the ground.
“I… I… I…” She just couldn’t get them out.  YOU RETARD !!!!  SAY YES !!! Y-E-S.  THAT ’S  ALL YOU NEED TO SAY !!!!  PLEASE !!!  YOU ’RE  KILLING ME HERE !!!!  COME ON !!!
