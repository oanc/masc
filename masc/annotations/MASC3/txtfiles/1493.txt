I could hear the ambulance headed towards the front yard. They parked a few yards away from us; the lights on the truck flashing. I kissed my Casimir on the forehead. As he was loaded into the vehicle, he took the oxygen away from his mouth for a moment. In a raspy voice, he said to me, "I promise, I'll come back to you."? He gently let go of my hand, and I remained standing there. It was as if my feet were planted to the ground. I waved as I watched the ambulance fade into the distance. They did not allow me to ride with Casimir; Ms. Ledezma had asked.
I was crying still, as I looked up at the clear blue sky. The revelation hit me, and I was dumbfounded. Could it really be so? The dream's foretelling had meant much more than I had imagined.

Amid my efforts to compose myself the best I could, I heard a familiar sound. It was the coo of a dove. The white bird flew overhead, and it landed a few feet away from me on a shrub. I beckoned it to come closer, and slowly, it did. "Hello again,"? I breathed, a part of me wondering if I was still dreaming. I lightly pinched myself. No, I was truly awake. I stared into the dove's shining eyes and felt its gaze upon me. After a moment or so, I noticed that the bird was carrying a little white paper in its beak. "What do you have there?"? I asked the dove softly. Presently, it dropped the rolled up paper. "Thank you,"? I whispered. "You knew right where to find me."? Once again, I looked up at the sky, as to say hello to God. I carefully unrolled the tiny paper, and it revealed to be a message written in typed black letters.
"If you love someone, then you have to be willing to let them go. And if it is true love, then they will come back to you."?

I held the message to my heart and sobbed continuously. I looked at the dove once more, and it looked back with knowing eyes. After a miniature eternity, I went back to the gazebo. I tucked the paper into the pocket of my pajamas. I figured it was around 9:00 in the morning by now. Another firefighter was talking to Mr. Brown, and he announced that it was safe to go back inside the house. I could still smell the smoke, but not as strongly as I could before. Most of the fire damage had occurred in the kitchen, as well as the adjoining breakfast nook and parlor. Someone had left a casserole in the oven for too long. Thankfully, nothing important had been destroyed. The only person who was harmed by the fire was Casimir, but he had no burns. The smoke had gotten into his lungs, and he was having some trouble breathing. He was the person who mattered the most in my book. Nevertheless, the firefighters reported that no one was killed in the fire, and the destruction and injuries had been minimal.

As I walked back to the house with the others, I met the eyes of the firefighter. He looked to be in his early thirties, and he was muscular with auburn hair. "Hello, there. You showed a lot of concern for that chap a while back. I warrant he's lucky to have such a caring sister."? he said this with the English accent that I had grown so accustomed to over the past two months. "Oh, I'm not his sister,"? I replied softly."Alright then,"? he said, raising his eyebrows."I'm his girlfriend,"? I finished confidently, with a sudden burst of boldness. I smiled and proceeded on my way. I heard the firefighter chuckle to himself and mumble something like, "Eh, sweet puppy love!"?I trotted back to the main living room, my step somehow feeling lighter. While the apprehension of Casimir's well being still occupied my mind, I knew that God and his mother would take care of him.

It had been a dream that had led me to Casimir, and it was a dream that would lead me back to him as well. Or, rather, a dream that gave me the faith he would return. I knew this wouldn’t be our last good bye, and I knew that I could be acting a bit over sentimental. But that didn’t matter. When my troubled friend was in trouble, it was inevitable that I would worry. I wondered how Mr. Chrysanthemum would react when he found out that his asthmatic son was in a fire. Presumably Casimir was relatively unharmed, but still the one who suffered the most from the house fire. Would he care? Would he call to see if Casimir was okay? Or would he even find out at all? Maybe he didn’t want to hear about his son. But perhaps if he saw Casimir’s diary, then his attitude would change. I’d have to bring up the idea with Casimir sometime. I wondered if he would feel any reluctance towards the matter of his father reading the journal. I deemed it couldn’t hurt to try it.

Casimir could leave the book on his night table the next time his dad returned, and then Arthur would see it. I made a mental note to mention this to my dear "boyfriend."?When I went back to the house, I had breakfast. The staff had a meeting about fire safety, as well as not leaving casseroles in the oven and forgetting about them. I walked around the house to pass the time away, and I wrote some letters. Then, I decided to go up to Casimir's room. It was strange, because it was empty, and everything was still. The same old blue striped handkerchief was on the nightstand. Casimir once told me the story behind it. His father had had the tissue in his pocket the day he and his wife got in the car crash. After Carlena Leigh died, Arthur used that very handkerchief to wipe his tears. One day, when he went to see Casimir as he was supposedly taking a nap. But Casimir soon woke up as his father entered the room, and Mr. Chrysanthemum began to cry.

Casimir, who was four at the time, started to sob amid his father's tears. "Then, my father took the handkerchief out of his pocket and said, "˜Here, son. Dry your eyes. I don't want you to cry"¦' And so I held onto it. The tears didn't stop for a while. My father didn't quite know how to comfort a sobbing four year old whose mother just died. But I guess he tried. He put his hand on my shoulder and made an effort to console the both of us. And, perhaps in a way, it did help; if only for a little while. Yet now we have each other. Friends help each other through life's storms"¦"? Casimir had said to me. There was a sad twinkle in his eye as he told me the story.

I noticed some pleasant differences about his room. The wedding picture of his mother and father was displayed on a table in the bedroom. The porcelain rabbit with the piercing blue eyes was right next to it. I realized that the bathroom door was open. I stepped inside, and there was a shocking sight that lay before me. But this time, I did not behold a gruesome manifestation of anguish. This time, it was a lovely surprise. I saw the cranes I had made for him hanging from little hooks on the bathroom ceiling. The paper birds flew above my head, each different in their own way. I hadn’t expected to find all of this, and I could recognize what Casimir was trying to say to me—that I had left a mark that wouldn’t be forgotten. Then, another idea occurred to me. I found Casimir’s journal and got a pencil.

In my neatest handwriting, I wrote:
Dear Casimir,
God, your mother, and the rest of the angels and saints are watching over you. The sun is rising, and the doves are bringing peace. I hope you are feeling alright. I know it isn’t easy, but I want you to try this whenever life is getting the better of you. Breath in what is good, and breath out what is bad. That is what my dear friend McKenna taught me to do. You’ve shown me so much of your soul this summer, and you have become my best friend. I love you not out of pity, but out of, well, love. Compassion has brought together our once contrasting outlooks, and we both came into each other’s lives at just the right time. I needed a friend to confide in, and you needed new hope, and ultimately, renewed faith. That evening when you kissed me, I was soaring among the stars, and I wanted the moment to last forever.

We are both so young, and we may not have traveled the furthest physical distances or seen much of the world. Though, I must add, being in London was as far away from home as I've ever been. Nevertheless, it was the place where I found you. So, I consider coming here to be a blessing. The matter is, what we truly needed was probably closer than either of us had imagined. Now, as I write this, I think back to the time we watched "The Wizard of Oz."? Towards the end of the film, when Dorothy is leaving the Land of Oz, she comes to a very important realization. Dorothy says, "If I ever go looking for my heart’s desire again, I won’t look any further than my own backyard. Because if it isn’t there, I never really lost it to begin with."? I will always remember that line.

Similarly, love, hope, faith, strength, and a sense of peace will never be as far away as they may seem. The Lord will never stop loving His children, and there shall always be at least a little bit of goodness in the midst of pain and suffering. I believe that is why the birds serenade, as they did on the day I discovered your journal. Now, with little more to say than the outpouring of words in my heart can expound, I will tell you in the simplest way that I know how: I love you. Casimir, you have the ability to impact those around you in ways that others could never understand or attempt to undertake. Never stop believing in the promise of truth and the happiness of love. Most of all, never stop believing that God loves you more than you could ever imagine in your wildest dreams.
Love always, Essie

At first, I contemplated over whether or not I should write an entry from Casimir’s mother. Ultimately, I had decided against it, out of the fear of making him sad. After all, what if he really believed that it was his mother writing to him? So I decided to compose a letter from myself. I reckoned it would be a nice surprise for him, as was seeing the cranes hanging up for me. I put the journal back where I had found it, and I walked out of the large room.
Later that day, Ms. Ledezma received a phone call from the hospital. It was reported that Casimir was doing fine, and he would be home in three days at the most. He couldn’t talk to me, because they said that he ought to save his voice. I could go and visit him tomorrow, because it would really cheer him up. He had probably expressed this to the hospital, despite the fact that he could hardly breathe.

That night, I climbed into bed and waited for tomorrow to come. When I was in a deep sleep, the dream from the night before picked up where it had left off. Casimir had returned, and we sat in the grassy meadows together. He picked a dandelion and blew on it. "What did you wish for?"? I asked him. His eyes twinkled and he smiled at me. "I think you've already figured out my wish,"? Casimir replied. "It was to be loved, am I correct?"? I asked him with a knowing look."Yes, yes indeed,"? he purred softly. "And you have fulfilled it."?I tucked back a lock of hair that fell in his face. "So tell me,"? I began, "What did you have to go back for?"? I was still curious. Casimir chuckled lightly. "In so many words, my inhaler!"? He kissed my nose playfully. We remained in each other's arms till our surroundings faded into a beautiful mist. The dream bid farewell to night and said hello to morning.

To my disgust, all the computers had been wiped. We had captured the equipment, which was something, but the scooters had bought the operator enough time to scrub the holographic storage. There were ways of retrieving trace data from it, but I’d leave that to the forensic boffins who’d follow up our capture.
I headed back out to Tasha. “We’re done here. Pop the trunk, want to check on our prisoner.”
“Is not necessary,” Tasha said. “He is doink fine.”
“He’s not fine, his arm’s off!” I said. “Have you radioed ahead for medical to be on alert?”
“Ah…yes. Am havink done that very think.”
Tasha is a terrible liar. I frowned, and started walking around to the driver seat—then at the last moment, reached down to slap at the emergency quick-release button for the trunk lid. It popped open, and I stared down into—
—a puddle of reddish goo in the bottom of the trunk. Silvery nanites were threaded all through it, and a few white chunks of bone stuck up here and there.
I found myself wanting to puke all over again.

I slammed the trunk closed and leaned against Tasha as I retched. “What the—what the hell did you do?” I gasped, when I could speak again.
“Am beink—I am sorry,” Tasha said, her accent vanishing almost completely. “You weren’t supposed to see that.”
“Answer the damn question!” I growled. “I want to know what you just used me to do.”
“It’s a standard Marauder procedure,” Tasha explained. “I read his mind into holographic storage and dissolve his body to be used for—ah, lubricant, sealant…”
“…fuel.” My blood ran cold, and this time my dinner finally managed to find its way onto the pavement. The enormity of my crimes had just hit me.
All those years, I had rounding up helpless civilians into trucks and buses to be hauled off to the nearest Marauder processing base. Not to be held hostage, the way I had assumed—but to be scanned into storage and rendered down into fuel. Processed.
I was an accomplice to the murder of literally thousands of people.
Including Philip.

The police officer walked out of his cruiser along with my mom. He knocked on Brent’s door and his mom answered, “Well aren’t we up all bright and bushy-eyed. Good morning Officer.” Brent’s mom’s kind voice fluttered in the morning air.
“Good morning Mrs. McCullen, is your son here?”
“Yes but I’m afraid he’s asleep still.”
“Do you know where he was yesterday?”
“Of course. He was out on his ol’ boat. Came back round…oh…7 and was out there cleaning it until 10.”
“Do you know if he was with anyone?”
“Oh golly I hope so. Brent needs a girlfriend dearly. Seems to just sit around the house and mope all the time.”
“Was he with Jameson?”
“Oh gosh no. The poor dear has been locked away from our home since….well forever.”
“Okay thank you.”
This entire time my mother has been sitting in the wings looking smug, but as the officer walked away her smug smile faltered, “Wait, you aren’t cuffing him….again?!”

I watched as the officer sighed then turned to look at my mother, “Mrs. Peters, we have a whole filing cabinet full of complaints about your neighbors here, but they’re all false.”
“No they’re not. What are you talking about?”
The officer ignored her and continued, “And soon I’m going to come her and arrest you for fraud. Now I’ll be off.” He got into his cruiser then and drove off, my mother’s mouth agap, “So how is that daughter of yours anyway?” Mrs. McCullen asked, “I haven’t seen her in years.”
My mother turned away from our house to look Mrs. McCullen straight in the eye, “Yeah, and that’s the way it should be.” Then our front door slammed shut. I quickly rushed back into my room and sat on the ground, staring at the door to the outside world.
I know Mother will take her anger out on me. So I just sat and closed my eyes, preparing for the blows that I knew would come soon.

“I want to tell you how I got this…AIDS I mean.” I watched Liam lean in slightly at the sound of her words, “So I was walking to my car after a job interview and a man told me he needed my help, so I decided to be a good citizen and help him out. Problem was, he wanted….a different kind of help…with something I didn’t want any part of.”
“Mom…you….you were raped?” Liam could barely get the word out.
She nodded, “Yes. But you know the good thing about it?”
“What?” Liam hissed the word, still taking in the vile fact that his poor mother was raped.
“If I wasn’t raped then I wouldn’t have gotten you for a son.”
“Mom I-” Liam paused to suck in a ragged breath, “I love you. You can go now.” He stood up and kissed her forehead, “Good-bye.”
“I love you too honey. And I will not forget you when I’m in heaven dear.”
“Thanks Mom.” Then Liam left the room so no one else saw him break down and really cry.

I drove for about an hour. I became more worried with each passing minute. My hands eventually began to shake, and I gripped the steering wheel tighter. It was so dark, I could scarcely even see the road.
Finally, my car’s headlights caught something. I quickly stopped and hopped out of the car to see three figures in the middle of the road, near a parked car. One of the figures was standing perfectly still. The other two were in a rather brutal fight.
I heard grunting, yelling, and whimpering. In the dark, I could not make out whether these shadows were women or men. But, the smaller of the two seemed to be winning the fight. Kicks and punches were continually thrown until the larger figure fell to the ground in pain, dropping a small object from their hand.
The person that had remained immoble now ran toward the winner of the fight. I caught a glimpse of them in the lights coming from my car and saw that it was Wesley and Joe.
