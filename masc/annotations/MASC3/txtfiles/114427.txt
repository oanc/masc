Hello Greeting from Linda!

Before i proceed sir, how are you today? Hope you are in perfect  condition of health, which is the most priority in
life. My name is  Linda.

I know that you may be so astonished how i get your email address. I saw  your email address on a forwarded page so i
decided to extend my  felicitations to you, presently i can not really specify what prompted  my drive to write but i
did have the mind that you could be a nice  person, then i feel to drop this few line of words to you, wishing that  we
can make it together to become friends. Remember that age, color or  distance or even language does not matter but true
love matters a lot in  life.

I will be very happy if you could write me back, so that we can get to  know each other better and share our feelings
and see what happens in  future, and also to view our photos as well, i will be waiting to hear  from you. Thanks and
have a pleasant day. Yours new friend.
   
   Linda Abars.
