The student: If you would keep reading, you might acutally learn something.
You might learn that:
1. ‘Getting over it’ means more than you think.
2. ‘Getting over it’ means nothing at all.
3. Lying to yourself is not healthy.
4. Violence is not the answer. (I think you should apologize to that pencil of yours.)
Alright, today’s lesson is over. Now let’s go over the homework, a personal narrative.
When I left, I knew it was for good. There was no going back to that almost perfect life we had. She wanted me out, and honestly, I did too. I felt I deserved more. I felt I could do so much better if someone would give me a chance. I wanted to forget what I was leaving behind, but that face, that voice, was all I could think about. For years, I suffered. All it took was a single spark to light the fire that burnt down our entire foundation. Too bad…
Any volunteers to read theirs? Show of hands please. Ah, Anessa. Go ahead.

The door of the chapel opens, admitting an emperor, two priests, a scholar, and the wind. The wind circles once around the grey hall, sending dust in flight where it touches the floor with its searching fingers, and stealing away the smoke of the incense from the hands of the priests. “Ahtranir…” The scholar mutters the unpronounceable word with awe, gazing around at the grey stone arches.“I’m glad that you like it,” the emperor says coldly- or perhaps that is just the snow building up by the cracked open door. “You shall have the honor of spending your last days here, due to your lack of cooperation.” The scholar’s eyes grow wide. “You wouldn’t,” he says.“Oh, I would,” the emperor says almost gleefully.“I taught you! I’ve known you since you were a child! You can’t! you can’t…” “You may be educated,” says the emperor, “but you still have much to learn.” The door is shut on the screams of the chapel. Surprisingly, however, the screams are not of the scholar. They are of the wind.

I nominate .:Band Baby:.,
I nominate her because of the huge amount of ficlets she has written. Also because she has done a lot of  AMAZING  series. For example, her series with Bartimaeus is epic. It is just epic. I was hooked on the story from the very beginning.
Secondly because she is really nice. Her comments are really encouraging. Never a put down. If its bad, she tells you how to fix it without even saying it is bad.
Lastly because she makes an amazing writing partner. I don’t think I could work with anyone as well I work with her.
All of those are what I think makes a great ficleter. That is why I nominate .:Band Baby:..

When you’re the oldest of a family of four, you kind of assume you know everything. That everyone in your family is happy with what they have. For instance, my little sister only has a little brother, and then me and our other brother. I assume she’s happy with the setup, because, you know, she has me. And then when our cousins come to visit, she’s all over the two-year-old and three-year-old girls. She invents the stupidest games, talks to them like they’re babies, and carries them everywhere like they never learned to talk. She’s been doing this for as long as I can remember, and it’s always annoyed the heck out of me. But as I’m staring at her completely hog my little cousin in the pizza place, and epiphany has dawned on me. She wants a little sister!Who’d’ve thought?

I sighed and crumpled my sixth sheet of smooth white paper beneath my fingers, loaded with bejeweled rings. This was useless. I stood up, straightening the folds of the satin gown that hugged my figure wit a holly-berry crimson color. The sunlight slanted lazily in to the dark room – who cared if the lights were on? Not like I did. A car honked impatiently outside. Time to go. It wouldn’t matter that I hadn’t left a note anyway, in twelve hours.

At 11:36 PM, it was obvious that she was not coming home.
Eli Albertson was liked to keep things in track. He time-stamped anything and everything that he could. He made sure there was at least one clock in every room of his recently redone house, and worked in even-numbered time slots.
Eli worked from home, mostly. In fact, that was mostly what he had done at home lately: work. It was because of this that, on one particular Saturday, he somehow missed his wife’s disappearance.
Angela was calm and gracious- the darling of the neighborhood, if you will. Still, there were moments when someone would catch her looking off into the distance- not at anything in particular, but just looking.
At those times, she seemed so far away that it wouldn’t have surprised anyone a bit if she just drifted into nothingness.

December 24th and I'm sitting in the back of an over crowed pub listening to the most boring person I've ever met drone on about the precise way to cook a chicken in his new easy-bake microwave; what a great Christmas Eve this is turning out to be. "Usually the oven is meant to be at 200 C but in the Micro-Zap, well it does it  ALL  for you, all you have to do is put in the weight of the item you want to cook, but it has to be the actual weight, not just a weight you guessed. Ha-ha no silly, that would be ludicrous."? Chuck, the copy editor from the magazine Live Right, Love Life often speaks in his English accent and as if his lungs are about to shrivel up from the lack of oxygen. Twenty-seven years old, flaming red hair and freckles that cover his nose and seem to spread all over the rest of his body, I imagine he wasn't too popular in high school either, especially if he spoke the same way as he does now.

Sure he's not the most interesting guy in the world, but he does have his moments of surprising you when you least expect it; like last year during the Easter holiday office party. Everyone was crowed around the food table, Chuck still talking about some slightly off-putting subject such as PÃ¢tÃ© de foies de canard (duck liver pate) for instance, when out of no where he comes out with "Wow, that's a really nice skirt you've got on, does it come with an easy-access hole?"? Now, however inappropriate this may be it was still humorous considering it was Stacey Newman to whom he was referring to, and as hard as it was for me, I made an exception to his crude behavioural outburst. There's a story behind Stacey Newman, but we'll get to her later, this part of the story is how miserable I was on Christmas Eve. A day in which people are joyous and celebrating a sacred religious festivity that I was brought up to also celebrate and enjoy, but recently it just seemed pointless.

For what ever reason, I just wasn't interested in all the hustle and bustle that it involved. Why can't Christmas be like it used to be, back in the day of old Saint Nick who brought presents to the children of the town through the goodness of his heart, not like today where everyone does something to get something in return? There's always an expectation that if you give you will get. I was always taught that it is best to give than receive, and that is the greatest gift of all. Growing up as a middle child actually made that slightly easier too for me to understand and respect, especially as there were four other children in the family. Four brothers and me being the only girl, I had learnt to not put any expectations on the opposite gender. I learnt this at a young age, "Never trust a boy, they only want one thing and they're not getting it from my little girl"? my father would say with a stern look on his face and a wrinkle in his brow.

I understand that parents are there to protect you from harmful and scary things and to hold your hand though hard times, but where are they when you’re a little older and life throws you a curve ball? They don’t catch it for you, or even lift you up so you’re able to reach it, no, they just stand in the crowd cheering you on to give you encouragement. Yes, but that’s all they seem to do. All through my teenage years I thought that my parents were like some aliens from outer space, put here only for humiliating me whenever it was possible, and that was most of the time. But enough about them, the main thing is that they were supposed to protect me from harmful things, but they didn’t. The reason I am sitting here alone with Chuck is purely based on the fact that my life used to be better than this. One wrong turn lead to the next and before you know it eight years has past and although I have many material things to show for it, I have nothing of value.

“Can I help you?” He said snidely.
Obviously, John was not a morning person and not happy to have been woken at this hour.
“Mr. John James?” The man sneered.
“Yeah,” John answered, rubbing his eyes.
“Good.” The man cleared his throat. “Mr. James, I am Sergeant Helton. We have been informed that you may be in violation of code 8-6-7-P-G-M-5-3-0-9.” He paused, “Which in civilian terms is Polygamy under the new “Gay” Marriage law.”
John raised his brow incredulously at Sgt. Helton, “What?”
Helton smiled sympathetically, “Do you or do you not co- habitate with Livia James and David Saint?”
“Uh, yeah,” John stammered, “But Dave is our roommate.”
“I am sure he was,” Helton cut him off, “However, the law permitting same sex marriages- and letters were sent out; co- habitating adults, of consenting age… Common Law marriage rules apply. Mr. James, you are under arrest.”

I could not see one persons face in the entire crowd. As we neared the refreshment table, I got a quick glimpse beyond the table down the darkened hallway. There, just for a brief second, I saw someone wearing a black trenchcoat dart up the stairway.
I grabbed Denny’s arm, pulling him close. I had to yell for him to hear me. “Get the punch, I’ll be back.” Denny nodded.

Why is this so secretive, maybe its something personal, i don’t know, maybe somebody, or his family, or maybe someone he likes…

I sit here and stare at this lake. Watching the world end around me. My family is gone. I am alone. I hear no screams where I am sitting. I counted the meteorites speeding through the atmosphere. Earthquakes, fire, tornadoes. But this lake is calm. I hear a tree begin fall behind me. I don’t look. I could care less if it was coming towards me. I hear it crash. I take off my shoes and stick them in the lake. It feels strangely warm.
I hear calling for me. I ignore the calls of the stranger. I have a smile on my face, as the sky burns a violent orange. I watch a few birds fly over the mountains in the distance. Suddenly, my arm gets tugged by the man calling for me. I tell him to let go. In the middle of pulling, however, a small meteorite slams into the lake, about a quarter of a mile away. He scrambles away. I sit back down, and watch the violent ripples in the lake. I grow tired, and lay my head back. I fall asleep, trying to ignore the sounds of the apocalypse.

Now, if you had read closely, you would’ve realized that I said textbook, not teacher, but I guess you take things your own way.
Mr. Wrong:
I repeat, I feel nothing. I learned nothing. You are nothing.
Okay, that was a little harsh, so let me rephrase that. You are nothing to me. You never were.
Is that better? I think so.
Pop quiz time! Do you remember anything else about me? Like how I always did my homework, whether the teacher liked it or not?
It took me a while to calm down, but hearing his heavy footsteps walk away made it a whole lot easier. As I regained my composure, I realized I should be laughing, not clenching my teeth together. A burden was lifted off my shoulders, my only burden for that matter. I felt free, vindicated, and that feeling lasted for so many years. Why did I go back?
