This is the last timeThe last time I cry over you being gone. The last time I feel empty. I can’t change itAnd my heart needs to heal.
This is the last time I mourn. The last time I am angry. The last time I can’t breathe. I can’t save youAnd I don’t want to be lost.
This is the timeThe time I smile over how long we had you. The time I start to live my life. I can’t change itAnd I have your memory.
This is the timeThe time I say, “I miss you.” The time I carry you in my heart. I can’t save youAnd you saved me from living selfishly.
This is the timeThe time I live for you.

I challenge you to write a tribute to friendship.
It can be in the form of a story, poem, etc. You can write about how much your friends mean to you, and a time you spent with them that you will never forget.
Or, you could write a story about two friends that move away or grow apart, and if they get through it in the end.
Basically, you can write about anything that has to do with friendship.
I am totally going to enter this one. Happy ficleting, and remember to always cherish your friends!

This was a tribute to friendship that I composed. I gave it as a speech at my birthday party one year. I wrote it so that my friends would know how much they meant to me, and how important friendship is. Here’s the tribute.
We are all here for the same reason. We are present on this day and time to celebrate the essence of friendship through activities, fun, singing, cake, and enjoying the company of one another. Each of us is here today because we are considered special, valuable souls by the irreplaceable people in our lives – our friends. Though many people who were invited to this gathering were unable to be present today, they are still cherished by us, for they are our dear friends. We are all God’s children, and we have all been blessed in many ways. One of the greatest blessings that He has bestowed upon us is the gift of friendship. So, today we will remember this, and may it never be forgotten. I hope you guys have a blast!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

…….I have great friends who have been brought up in loving, dedicated, scrupulous, Christian families. As for everyone in my grade, though, that’s a different story. You see, there is this girl who recently started sitting with my friends and I at lunch. She’s not exactly the nicest or most agreeable person, but she’s still a person. There is another girl in my grade who pretends to be friends with her, but is really only using her. I don’t think that’s right, because it is important to be friends with people for the right reasons. Anyways, the girl was sitting right in the middle of our group at lunch today. I’ll admit that none of us were happy about it, but it’s not the worst thing that could ever happen. I mean, in the end, my friends and I are happier people than she is, so why not be nice to her and let her sit with us? Not everyone has a kind, loving family, so not everyone has a good foundation. But values are important, and they last a lifetime.

Believe it or not, the girl taught me a lesson. You should be nice to everyone, no matter who they are. No matter how hard any situation is, you have to learn to practice good values and deal with it. I learned that I need to pick friends for the right reasons. I have the freedom to choose my own friends and the self-assurance to not come off as fake or untrue. Ultimately, friendship must be genuine. It cannot be based on using or pity, or else you are not being fair to either of you. Yes, you can show kindness toward someone and have a positive impact on their well-being, but the truth still stands: friendship must be genuine.
Yours truly, Me

Okay, I said a lot in yesterday’s entry, but there’s something that I didn’t say—what friendship can be based on. The list is a pretty long one… kindness, compassion, confidence, trust, understanding… and ultimately love. Also, it is possible to feel bad for someone and still be their friend, as long as pity isn’t the foundation of the friendship. This is not the case with the girl I mentioned before. But it is with another individual—Beth. It’s true that the flames have died down, and things have somewhat blown over. Life appears to be back to normal, but really, is it? No. I don’t think so. And neither does anyone else. There are definitely still some hard feelings, as the tension didn’t just magically disappear. But I still think there’s hope. There has to be. After all, by now I have learned to tell the difference between a friend, an acquaintance, and a foe. Beth is a friend.

I see that, Julie sees it, but what about the others? True, they’ve been hurt by Beth, but can’t they give her another chance? They’re all good people, and I think it’s sad that they would consider ending a friendship due to some stupid mistakes made by a well-meaning person. Julie is a true friend because she stayed by Beth’s side through the storm. My mom, as well as Julie’s mom helped out at the Hunger Meal at school today. She was talking to my mom, and even told her how Julie felt about the whole Beth thing—Julie was sad that everyone else didn’t want to be Beth’s friend anymore. Mom talked about me, and Julie’s mom talked about Julie. No surprise they found out how much we had in common. I always knew I was a lot like Julie, as we’re both unique, intelligent, creative individuals. We both love to write.

But unfortunately, we’re both shy as well, so that makes things a little difficult. Julie’s mom suggested that we get together sometime, and I think that is a great idea! A really great idea! But that’s all it is now—an idea. However, I’ve made ideas realities before, so I can in this case too. I’ll invite Julie over sometime. And who knows, maybe I’ll even let her read one of my journal entries. Perhaps this one!

Do you know what's really hurtful, pathetic, stupid, unfair, and just downright pointless? It's when a group of people pretend to be friends with someone. I've talked about it before, and I still feel very strongly about the issue. A lot of times people "include"? (notice the word is in quotes) a person in their clique, but don't put their heart and soul into the friendship. It may be because the person is popular, or because they have cool stuff, or because they have some kind of authority. Or maybe it's because the person is pitiful, and people can't help but feel bad for them. That really bites. I take friendships very seriously, and I don't want anyone to go through meaningless ones.

Think about it this way"”God intended for all of us to meet special people who would leave footprints in our hearts. And sometimes we have to keep looking to find those people, because they are out there. This reminds me of the saying, "best friends are like four-leaf clovers"”hard to find but lucky to have."? It speaks the truth. You just can't lose faith in the essence of true friendship. If you do, life loses some of its meaning.

…..I have to find greater happiness in reality. I know how to come out of my shell and be the real person my friends have grown to know and love. I know how to manage social situations. And I think I know what it means to be truly in love with a boy. (Daniel.) But my fantasies never go away. And to be honest, I don’t want them to either. For daydreaming is an important part of my life, as it always has been. The thing is, however, I’m no longer in 1st grade anymore. I’m far past 6th grade too. Even so, I always feel more comfortable daydreaming than in a group of people. But if I always lived my life like that, daydreaming in the midst of fate, of what was meant to be, I wouldn’t get nearly as much out of life. If that was all I did this year, then who knows what I would be like? I wouldn’t know what it means to discover good, quality friends created by God above who open my eyes by sharing their viewpoints and personalities.

I wouldn’t know what it was like to forgive someone for wrongdoing, and become friends again after a fight. I would never get to experience the joy of going to a birthday party, or sharing my poems. Inside jokes would be obsolete. Laughter would be rare. That’s how life would be without friends, if I never found the valuable treasure of friendship. After a while, I’d start to feel lonely. In the end, I would have regrets. So the matter is, I’m not going to let that happen again. Even though I sometimes think life would be easier without commitments or responsibilities, it definitely wouldn’t be better. For I care about my friends as they care about me. I am willing to make sacrifices for them, and be there when they need me the most. I know they would do the same. And by keeping the promise I made to myself, I really gained a lot. I learned to cherish what I have while it is with me. And by doing this, I realized that it will never be completely gone.

The sun, sinking down into the sea, cast a strange eerie glow on the land, making the sinister castle look even darker than usual.
A farm boy slunk towards the castle, his amber hair stuck out and his drab clothing made him look shrunken and small. He looked behind him regularly, anxiously, as if someone might be following him.
In fact, right behind him, was a man of slight build. His dark clothing let him drift seamlessly in and out of the shadows. He, too, was looking, but not behind. He was looking up.
Up in the third tower lay a woman. Not really a woman, for she was only fourteen. Her cheek bones were pulled tightly over her face, giving her a pained look, and she was impossibly thin, but everything else about her was perfect. Her dark hair flowed around her face, and her closed eyes. Her breathing was shallow and labored.
Right outside the door stood a man in a white coat and trousers. He put his ear to the door, and then, as if satisfied, he turned and strode back down the corridor.

June 7, 2008
Today, one of my friends had a birthday party. I had a really awesome time hanging out with my friends. When we went swimming, I was the only one who wouldn't dive into the pool. You could tell that I wanted to, but I was still afraid. You see, I know how to swim, and if I were stranded in a lake, I could stay afloat for a little while. But I'm definitely not a strong swimmer. My friends know this, but they also knew how much I wanted to dive in. So as I stood at the edge of the pool, unable to take a step forward, one of my friends asked, "Do you want me to push you in?"? I nodded. When she did, I realized that there was nothing to be afraid of. So when another girl shoved me in after that, I was prepared. Besides, I wasn't the only one that she pushed in the pool. But to be honest, I think I was the one who needed it the most"”not necessarily from that girl, but from my friend. For true friends give you a push when you need it.

When they know you can swim, but just can’t muster up the courage to dive in, they give you a little push in the right direction. Then, you realize what you were missing out on the whole time, and you never let that opportunity go to waste again. Overall, true friends help you to overcome your fears so you can become a stronger person. I guess this has happened many times this year, and it will happen several more—-my friends taught me more than I could ever know alone, even if they weren’t always right. But that is why I trust in God above all else. However, I never let them drag me down when they were wrong, because I knew that I could trust in myself to have good judgment. But without my friends’ support, I wouldn’t be the girl that I am now. Besides, even if friends aren’t always right, as long as they are kind, dedicated, caring, and with good intentions, then chances are, they’re pretty awesome people. I know that my friends are, and I don’t know what I could do without them.

Through the experiences I have had in my life, especially this year, I have come to see a concept in a new light. I already knew that Jesus died on the cross so we could have the gift of everlasting life, but I’ve realized something else too. God revealed to us who the Son of Man is. He gave us the essence of forever. Though we can never be superior like Him, we can still someday live in His kingdom for always. We will get to experience true happiness and feel the essence of forever. Even while we’re on earth, we might be lucky enough to get the tiniest glimpse of what the essence of forever could be. Though the moments are fugitive, we never forget them. They stay with us for the rest of our lives.

I believe that the joyfulness and bliss we feel remain in our hearts and never leave. The truth stays with us through the sorrow, the anguish, the pain, and finally the triumphs. It becomes a part of who we are. Part of that love is what God has bestowed upon us. He gives us our souls and our lives, and even the keys to the kingdom. Without God, there is no forever.

There are many things in life that make me happy, like a new poem completed, a rainbow, a perfect origami star, a 100% on a test, or a compliment from a friend. Obviously, I am contented with my life and confident in who I am. But lately, I find it hard to feel proud to be an American. It’s for a number of reasons, such as the wars we are in right now, including the one in Iraq, as well as the wars that have been happening ever since the beginning of time—-people, bitterly conflicting with each other, often over the most trivial things. Just remember what happened when the new Playstation or something-or-other came out. People were shooting each other so they could be the first ones to get it! Even though I haven’t witnessed either of these things first hand, I still have eyes and ears, so I’m not totally clueless as to what is going on in our world today.

I know that we are in the middle of an economic recession, and unemployment is rising. People are getting sick when they have no health insurance, and gasoline and grocery prices are through the roof. But really, do I know? Alas, it is more than these occurrences that have disturbed me, as well as countless others. Just think about America alone—-we over consume and overindulge. Yet at the same time, we are suffering greatly. True, we have many resources, but we misuse them and still want more. In addition to all of this, there are countries that far outdo us academically. Also, America is plagued with the issue of obesity, but at the same time, we are bombarded with images of what the "perfect"? body is supposed to look like. Those images just aren't real. The longing to be thin has thrown many young people off-track, and has resulted in numerous eating disorders.

In many ways, our nation is a disgrace. However, I am still aware of the things that make America remarkable and special. For instance, sometimes our resources are used for good, instead of evil and destruction. Kind, caring, dedicated Americans work to make the world a better place every day. Also, many people come to the United States seeking new jobs and opportunities. In America, you can be born poor and end up rich – just look at Oprah Winfrey. Not to mention that we have freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom to be ourselves – but only if we choose it. It is important that we never forget the essence of who we are – for that is something that no one can take away from us. That is, if we value it enough. We must stay true to ourselves and not give in to negative influences, no matter what. And ultimately, in the end, we are all children of God, no matter what our origin, status, or essence.

Some things I am meant to search for, others I am meant to find, and still others are meant to remain a mystery. Some concepts I just have to believe, even if I can’t see them—for they explain what I do have the capacity to understand. For example, I don’t completely know the essence of life—but I’ll tell you one thing for sure, I know it’s worth living. So I guess I’m just one of those dreamers who spends hours, days, weeks, months, and even years in deep thought; pondering the essence of life, along with the essence of forever. But I know they both exist, since I see them all around me. I see truth in the trees, the wind, the flora, the fauna, the fresh rain. I even find it in the pounding thunder that gives my dog, Checkers, a fright.

When I go to church, I am in the presence of God. I’m not there because my parents make me go—I’m there because my soul knows it is good for me. By now, I know that I am a person of faith, and I believe in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. I know that somewhere beyond time and space is a paradise known as heaven. To me, it feels almost impossible for there not to be a supernatural force that created the universe and loves each creation. Don’t get me wrong—after being alive for 12 years, I’m not oblivious to suffering. But I still know, or at least I think I know, that the world is founded on love. Even though not everyone acts kind or loving, and despite that some people still don’t believe in God, I believe that the love is still present.

It means more to those who practice good works, as well as preach them, than to those who merely preach their so-called "noble deeds."? The true believers are the happier people, especially in the end, because they're the ones who have learned the meaning of love, even if they're still pondering the essence of life. For they know that without God, the love would not exist, because God is love. So when I think about it that way, I am filled with faith that in spite of the harsh world we live in, there is still comfort even on the darkest night for those who believe.

Sometimes I wonder if the world has anything left to offer me. At times, it feels like all there is left are headaches and heartaches. DÃ©jÃ  vu is everywhere, but at the same time it's not enough to help me find the true comfort that I'm looking for. Even the pleasant memories and pastimes replay each other so much, yet so little, that it's a wonder that they haven't faded away completely. I want something new to hope for; something new to get excited about every day. I need the reassurance that "it's all good."? Yet I believe that I am being selfish on this matter; not so much for what I hope for, but for who I wish it upon. Instead of asking what the world has to offer me, I should be asking, "What do I have to offer the world?"?I bet countless other people are feeling the same emotions I am, just for varied reasons. Maybe someone lost their house or a parent or grandparent died. Perhaps someone's friends truly did abandon them.

After all, if you picture the world today, you'll see that many people are having trouble holding on when the going gets tough. And really, who can blame them? Not only are they struggling to pursue all of their goals, wishes, and aspirations, but they are also facing the hardship of makings ends meet. All of their hopes, confidence, and motivations to keep going come not only from the prospect of making themselves happy. They care about God, their families, their friends, their communities, and even the world itself. Sure, it's okay to be "in it to win it"? for the journey called life, but if winning and success are the only factors pushing you along, then you'll never make it to the finish line. Or if you do, no one will be there waiting for you. You'll realize that you never had much of an earnest motivation in the first place, and you'll never know what it truly feels like to be a winner. I reckon that's the reason why we have loved ones"”we help each other along the way, even when we fall.

Because of them, we have reasons to keep going not only for ourselves, but for others, too. So even when life seems grim, dark, and shadowy, we can still remember that we’re not alone. For there are people who need and depend on us, giving something more to live for. True, maybe they might leave us, or perhaps we hurt them or take them for granted. Or they may lose our trust because of their actions, or go up to heaven to be with God. I feel like I took Poppa for granted. He was always there, not just for me, but for our whole family. When he died, I didn’t truly have a real chance to cry. The truth is, losing him was exactly like losing a parent. The only thing that made it easier was that he was older. He was ready to see God. Alas, if one is willing to love, then they also must be willing to lose. I’m afraid I learned that the hard way. But what would the easy way be? Those words wouldn’t have meant anything to me unless I could actually relate to them to begin with. Now I can.
