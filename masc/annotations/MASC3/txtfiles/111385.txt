Greetings and God Bless You,


Be blessed as you read this mail with a divine understanding and as a channel to fulfil the Will of God through the lead
of the spirit. I, Mrs. Catherine William, 68 years old without a child, married to late Dr. William Johnson from Israel
who worked with Oil Company (PETROCI) Cote d'Ivoire before he died in the year 2008 after a Cardiac Arteries Operation.
Before the death of my husband, he deposited the sum of ($2.600.000. U.S D) two million six hundred thousand dollars in
a security firm here in Cote d'Ivoire for Charity work and propagation of the gospel. Presently, I am hospitalized as a
result of my sickness and my doctor confirmed to me that I may not last more than three months due to the seriousness of
my illness; The Bible says that all things work together for good to them that love God.

Therefore, With due Respect and Humanity after my prayer asking God to direct me to a God fearing person or a church
that will channel this Fund to the work of God so, I write to donate/ hand over this fund ($2.600.000.U.S D) to you for
orphanages, less-privilege especially those in the hospital without a medical attention due to lack of finance and
propagating the gospel of God. So, you are requested to send your full information such as:

Your names 
Telephone and fax number 
Resident address

For a legal documentation process in your name to transfer the fund to you without any hindrance to accomplish our vow
to God. Always pray for me daily. Thanks and waiting to read from you soonest.

Remain bless of God 
Mrs Catherine William
