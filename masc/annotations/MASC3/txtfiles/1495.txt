Once in the air I turned, to make it look like I was merely flying over them.
That’s when I made the plane dive. Right towards Willton. This small farmers plane was perfect for killing a man. Just perfect.
I tried to unbuckle my seat belt, but it was jammed. I cried aloud. I used all my force to cut the seat belt, but I couldn’t do it. Before I knew it, I had crashed, and I was in severe pain. I used all my force and finally broke the seat belt. I got lose, and looked around. The lot was empty. The 3 executioners and John Willton, were dead. I had done it. I saw my friends, huddled in a corner, and ran to them. They looked up and hugged me.
“We have to get out of here” I said.
We got into a nearby truck, and headed home. During the ride we were quiet. Just thinking about what we had witnessed. And what I have done.
“Nice job mate, you took down a insane man, and possibly an entire government.” My general said.
My plan worked.
But this war is only just starting.

She’s lost,Dazed and confused,With everything that left her. It hurts her every timeBut she can’t stop.
She’s closer than ever before,Fallen and broken,With no will to go on. It’s hurt is going to stop now,But she can’t do it.
She’s crying,Alone and on her own,With no one beside her. It wasn’t supposed to be like this,But she can’t help it.

She’s about to let go,Breathing and living,With the bullet loaded. It’s going to end,But she’s being stopped.
She’s not fixed,Bruised and confused,With all this pain. It hasn’t healed the scars,But she’s being hugged.
She’s still living,No longer alone and on her own,With the arms of a long lost friend. It has only just begun,But she’s not alone.
She’s not alone.

Nothing makes senseThese feelings with swingsBut who really wants to make up a thousand excuses?

Now this was my saturday….
Personally told Harvey Dent to screw off and took his hostages … well hostage.
Took said hostages to a bank.
Wired a bomb to the bank.
Fired a couple rounds into the air to trigger someone to call 911.
Had a coffee and waited.
—
The hostages grunted under the duct tape covering their mouths. I walked up to one grabbing one by the head. He repeled in horror and I noticed why, I had the gun to his head, Silly me. “No i’m not going to kill you, in fact once Batman comes i’ll let you all go.” I said lowering the gun.
—
I heard a window shatter above and looked at a security camera. “I’ve found my Bat! Hurry act like hostages and you won’t get hurt.” I waited for a response.“Well.” I said raising the gun. They began to squirm and kick and grunt. “Good.” I grinned.
—
“I have hostages down here! I can blow this building immeadatley if you even attempt to free anyone or kill me.” I yelled. He swooped down, trying to hit me.

This was it…the blood flowed through my veins..
My first kiss
I was ready to be enchanted and blown away.
He slowly started to lean towards me, closer..closer..closer…I could feel his hot breathe on my lipsHis lips started to partCloser..
Oh damn..I cant believe it!
He closed his eyes..was I supposed to close mine?Maybe I should suck on a mint before this..too late..
My eyes dilated..he was going in for the kill, my nose brushed against his..was that supposed to happen?
This is too much for me to handle..
Then our lips slowly touch, the feeling of excitement dissapears, and the nervous atmosphere slowly dissapears while I close my eyes and slant my head.
I wrap my hands around his neck, now standing on my toes, I feel an electric pulse running through my body.
I never want to let go…

I don’t want to go to bed because, sometimes, I’m afraid of what’s going to happen in my dreams.
Last night, I had a nightmare.
Not even just a scary dream.
It  WAS  a nightmare.
With dead people, dying people, and the worst of all… clowns.
 I HATE CLOWNS .
And what’s worse, the clowns were killing everyone.
I ended up dying.
It was horrible, and I hate clowns. Ever since I’ve seen It, I’ve been terrified.

When she sat down to another girl on the bus, the first thing that occurred to Chandra was how much she liked the other girl's hair. It was a superficial thought to have, but she thought the girl's straight red hair was very attractive.
"Hi,"? she said.
"Hello, Chandra,"? the girl said. Her eyes were closed and she was leaning against the window.
"Um, I didn't tell you that"¦"?
The girl's large blue eyes snapped open. "It's "“ on your duffel bag. I'm Fiona, by the way."?
"Nice to meet you, Fiona."? Chandra relaxed slightly. "Looking forward to Camp De-Cap-A-Lot?"?
"My parents are,"? Fiona said.
Chandra laughed. "So are mine."? There was a pause. "Uh, what's with the jacket in summer weather?"?
"A"¦ skin condition,"? Fiona said.
"Oh,"? Chandra replied.
"There's something up with this camp,"? Fiona announced, eyes closed again.
"Really?"?
"It's called De-Cap-A-Lot. As in decapitation. Which is another word for getting your head cut off."?
""¦Oh, gosh, you're right,"? Chandra said.
"Yeah.”

After ten or twenty minutes of amicable chatter, Chandra noticed the boy across the aisle. He was listening to his iPod and staring at the ground. He had curly brown hair and freckles. After a moment, the boy noticed her looking at him and turned.
"Oh, hi,"? he said. "I'm Oliver."?
"Chandra,"? she replied. "Nice to meet you."?
"Sooo, who's the redhead?"?
"I'm Fiona,"? the mentioned girl said unexpectedly. "I hate when people call me a ginger, considering I don't have freckles. Perhaps you've been called one before due to yours."?
He was rather creeped out. "I"¦"?
"I meant your freckles."? She opened her eyes. Oliver was very unsettled realizing her eyes had been closed the entire time.
"She’s great once you get to know her,"? Chandra said a tad desperately.
This caused a silence, after which Fiona said, "Oliver, do you watch Degrassi?"?
Oliver hesitated. "I've seen it, but it isn't that great."?
And with that, the three of them launched into a conversation about their favorite TV shows.

The trio walked off of the bus, and the campers gathered in front of the bell. They seemed to have fallen into little groups already. The first group, of course, consisted of Chandra, Fiona, and Oliver.
The second group was just a twosome, a girl with blonde braids and a black boy. She kept resting her head on his shoulder. He looked at the counselors, but didn't seem to be listening.
A third group was not talking at all. A Hispanic young man sizing all the others up; a woman with puffy blonde hair scribbling furiously on a notepad; a perky girl with stringy brown hair, who shockingly looked interested.
The last group consisted of three children and one boy in a black shirt nearby them, staring at the girl with blonde braids.
"So,"? Alex said happily, "six of you will go off and play badminton; six of you will go canoeing! Then, we'll have dinner! After that is bed."?
"And after bed,"? Fiona muttered, "somebody is going to sneak into our cabins and kill us."?
"What?"? Chandra asked.
"Nothing."?

I watched a sunset,Oh so fleeting,Fading to dusk,Day and night meeting.
If I could just pause my life,Put it on hold,It would be now I’d do it,For such moments are gold.
Sitting on the broken gate,Watching the last rays dip out of sight,The stars shining with faint light,I ponder my life of late.
Twilight is a torn time,A rather forlorn time,It’s more of a fork than ever I’ve seen,More than any other to me it does mean.
They say life’s a river, swept along in a rip tide,Some say life’s a path, but not so to me. Life’s a string, but to be cut by others I’ll not abide,Life is a twilight: truth this is to me.
And so I sit on twilight’s fence,Forced to choose from night and day. I cannot choose- I love them both!Neither way my mind can sway.

Watching the Joker’s brilliant idea, I decided to mask a hostage as no other but my beautiful self. Batman is stupider than he looks. Well you know I did the costume very well if I do say so myself.
—
The hostage hit the floor and stayed down. I reminded him through the ear piece he had that wasn’t visible to our bat.
“Remember what happens if you don’t play by my rules, remember i’ll do all the talking and you just stand there and be pretty.” I whispered.
—
The hostage got to his feet swiftly. I had a small speaker wired into the costume. So as long as the hostage followed suit, I could be there talking to Batman while talking through a hostage to Batman if that makes any sense.
—
“I’ll kill everyone in here if you take one step.” I said into to my microphone. I reached for the security guard hat and instantly thought myspace pictures. I reminded myself where I was. Batty went to kill the hostage.
—
I stepped out of my hiding spot.“Hey.” I said casually.

“Be careful what you wish for,” The wand’ring fey replied,“For if your wishing goes amiss,You’ll wish today you’d died.”
“Pah!” said the first man.“I take no heed of that. I wish for gold and silver,Enough to fill a cooking vat.”
Heartened by his fellow, the second man gave a shout:“I wish for a never-draining cup of wine!This way I’ll never be without.”
Said the third man, “I have a wish-I wish that I knew allKnowing why the wind doth blow-Knowing why the leaves doth fall.”
“Well,” said the fey, with a curl of the mouth.“I see that you are foolish, but who am I to say?I will grant your wish, but you shall see-You will regret it one day.”
With not a sound, the fey faded away. The men celebrated their sly. They walked to the village, with a shout and a hey,But foolish they were; a fey does not lie.

I laid in my bed, staring up at the ceiling while thinking of what to do. I had called Addy now…I’m not even sure how many times and she didn’t answer once. I huffed in frustration and pushed my messy blonde hair out of my face. I looked around my room, seeing my funeral clothes sitting on my desk’s chair. Just seeing and knowing what they were bought for brought bile to my mouth.
I brightened at the thought of running downstairs to ask Joel for help, but then I realized his current condition: passed out on the couch with an empty bottle of vodka in his hand.
Now that wasn’t like Joel whatsoever, but hey, it’s not every lifetime your loved one gets taking away from you.
My cellphone rang then and the caller ID said it was Addy and my heart inflated with happiness.
Perhaps people can forgive and forget.

I’m tired of waiting for you, it seems like I’m always doing it. I’m waiting for you to wake up, to answer a text, to get out of school, to stop “b.s.ing” (by the way, what exactly do you do while you’re bullshitting for 2 and a half hours?), to finish eating, to shower, to get over your period of selfworthlessness, to realize that all of your excuses for us not being together are fuckin’ ridiculous.

To bad I can’t cry. I just don’t have the strength to produce tears. You’ve stolen from me the last bit I had. Actually I don’t have a heart either. You’ve shredded the last little bits of that too.
How is it that you can make me so wonderfully happy one day and so completely miserable the next? How is it that you can light my world and then send it into utter darkness? Maybe you don’t realize that you do this. Maybe you don’t notice the agony you put me through. The suffering.
I’m not a hundred percent sure, but I don’t think love should be this way. I know we should have fights and disagreements and ocassionally hurt eachother but so soon and so much? I don’t know and I don’t understand.

When I look back on my life, the hardest thing to do is come to terms with who I used to be. What I used to believe, how I used to feel, what I used to do.
I have been through a lot. I’m not just saying that, if you ask me I can tell you. But I used to not be able to tell anyone, I was ashamed of myself. I still am, I don’t think anyone gets over the regret of past mistakes.
The reason I can tell you, is because who I am today, wouldn’t be existent without that piece of my puzzle. I’m a puzzle. Just like any puzzle, I’ve got my really easy edge pieces that are so easy to find. However, when you reach the center, the core, it’s harder to put me together.
Everyone used to call me, Kiki. I decided that the girl they knew, this Kiki, was someone who needed to grow up. I was given a second chance. I wanted to go back to my roots, acknowledge who I am. Keegan, is who I am, but I will always be Kiki to them, and I can’t change that. But here you are, calling me Keegan, reminding me that I survived and I am okay.

The man with gold and silverWas the first to meet his end. But at the time, he did not know,Still thinking it was a god-send.
He decided not to spend it,Chose to keep it locked away. He dug a hole and buried it there,About it to none he would say.
For several years, he felt secure,Sure that if disaster did comeHe would be safe, with his hidden hoardTo no misery he would succumb.
His gold he guarded carefullyLike a dragon and a lairBut for his gold he gave up moreMuch fell into disrepair.
To hire a guard for his gold, He sold away his horse and cowTo build a wall around the guard,He sold away the boar and sow.
Since he did not trust the guard,Up at night he did sit. And so for constant vigilanceHe sold his health, and time with it.
Despite his watching, day and night,Worry hid mind did hold. The thought of theft did drive him madFor the wealth, much else he sold.
First his horse and sow, Then his health and time,Soon after, his wife and daughter,And then, at last, his mind.

Dreamer.
She’s a dreamer. She thinks… hopes… that, that “love” they’re always talking about is real. She wants it.
She wants it bad.
She just… can’t wait to be tied to someone. Can’t wait for someone to mean the world to her. Can’t wait to care for someone that much.
She just can’t wait.
And she thinks about it…She thinks about it a lot. She thinks about it until she starts crying… starts wondering why she doesn’t have it. She makes herself feel, so so alone.
So what are you going to do. Tell her to get out of the dreamland? Tell her to stop dreaming? Stop hoping? Because it’s hurting her… it’s making her feel sad? Bad about herself?
Maybe it is. Maybe she shouldn’t be dreaming so much.
But who are you to say that? Who are you to tell her that it’s bad to be dreaming all of the time? Who are you to tell her to get out of her fantasy?
No one. And I’m no one too. We’re no one to tell her. So don’t look down on her.
She’s a dreamer. At least she’s something.

You latch onto things. It’s what you do.
You’re looking for things that might “be you.” You are looking for things to… define you.
You are going at it backwards. And you can’t see it.
It’s a funny thing. It really is.
It’s… odd. Looking at it from a different point of view. As in, watching someone else do it, instead of me.
Because I did it for so long. It was exhausting. I’m watching the same words come out… words that I thought for a long time.
For a while it was really frustrating, aggravating. So annoying. I’m not sure why.
But you know what? It isn’t anymore. Something’s changed… just a little bit.
Now I’m kind of just… sitting back and watching it unfold. Just like it did for me, in what seems like ages ago.
It’s really interesting. Really… really interesting. It kind of makes me think. Remember. Maybe smile a little.
You latch onto things. Things to define you, instead of things that define you.
It takes a lot to realize the difference.
