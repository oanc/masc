So there was this couple on Thanksgiving. They were all like “Hey it’s Thanksgiving. We should eat turkey and stuff.” So after they were done murdering their turkey, they stuck it in the oven. They left it in too long though (that’s what she said) and it burned to the point that it was no longer edible!!!!

The two men left standing stared at their comrade, who’s blood was splattered everywhere.
Then they both turned to me in a single motion, the triggers clicking at thesame time. Holy shit, I was on fire!
It hurt. I felt my eyes closing, and then I heard the man’s voice say,
“Excellent. Bring them into the extraction room.”
I pitifully struggled while they lifted me up and set me on a metal table, then strapped down my torso, each leg and muzzle.
Across the room I saw them doing the same to Jakob.
A loudspeaker called,
“All personel please go to your appropriate stations. Halfling approaching. Others approaching.”
Danny’s red eyes were wild, his leather jacket stained with blood, red, red, red, everywhere.
Danny was forced onto a table. Titanium straps flew from it to encircle him, holding him down securely..
Edward was brought in next, him set on a table and strapped down with magic-proof metal..
Why?
Why were we here?
I had a feeling we were just about to find out…

“Oh NO!” Barty said, examining the turkey. “This is definitely no longer edible. What do we do now?” His eyes shifted from the meal he could no longer eat to his wife, Betty, the smarter of the two.
“I know what to do,” she said excitedly, getting up from her chair and walking over to the fridge. “I saw this happen on television once. We can eat cereal!” Like a woman in a commertial, she pulled out a box of Frosted Flakes, giving her husband the thumbs up.
“See, this is why I married you,” Barty said, getting them a couple of bowls for their Thanksgiving feast.

I was right. The door slammed open, and a team of scientists entered, holding weird-looking gun things. At the same time I heard a voice say,
“Leave the wolves. Focus on the Halfling and the wizard. Suck them dry.”
I stared in absoulute horror as it was explained to me.
“Carlie. We knew who you were, we always did. You are our experiment. We don’t understand why you befriended the halfling or the wizard, but we will make them normal humans so they won’t bother you.”
My eyes grew large with rage and the straps snapped. I snarled with rage and advanced on the pitiful humans.
I? I their experiment? Oh, contraire, how wrong they were. And they were about to pay for it. With their lives.

Barty’s death was certainly odd. He’d taken a seat at the kitchen table, brought the spoon into the milk and taken one sip before keeling over, his eyes rolling back into his head.
Betty looked slightly panicstricken for a moment, but then an evil smile spread across her face. “Muahahaha,” she laughed miniachly. “Serves him right.”

The moment the car stopped, Karissa had Matt by the hand and was dragging him across the parking lot towards the Silver Diner. “Hey,” Matt protested halfheartedly. “What is it with you and dragging people places?” Karissa shrugged. “Not people. Just you, you seem to need to be dragged places sometimes.” Matt was at a loss which was okay because Karissa continued to speak. “Besides I can see that Brandy is really into Jordan and wanted to give them a moment.” Wow she’s perceptive. Matt thought admiringly.“So what about you?” Matt asked.“What about me?” She asked as he opened the door for her. “Aren’t you into Jordan?” Matt asked nervously. She didn’t seem to notice. “Please.” Karissa shook her head, dark hair bouncing. “He’s not my type.” What is her type? Matt wondered,and soon after that. Why should you even care? No more women. But he was wavering and he knew.

It was too bad Betty had planned for an alien attack her entire life since meeting an alien on the bus in high school. She grabbed the pepper spray she always carried in her purse and sprayed them until they beamed her back down to Earth, where she took a pan from the sink and hit Barty in the head with it. Watching him pass out, she smiled.
“Happy Thanksgiving.”

Too bad that it wasn’t the real Barty that she saw pass out on the floor. It was just a clone that the real Barty made when he was in college (he didn’t have many friends). The real Barty was currently living in Venezuela with his second family. Every month or so he would switch places with his clone and continue life in the new place.

Jason buried his face into the sleeve of his sweatshirt. A whole three hours had already passed and he still couldn’t believe it. Why would Kathy break up with him? Hadn’t they been in love?
Sometimes she’d gotten annoyed with him and his reoccuring habits. She’d always hated it when he’d listened to the radio in the car too loud or traced his fingers along her skin, but he hadn’t realized she’d been considering dumping him.
Three years down the drain.
He’d been sitting with her in the park earlier that day, watching the clouds slowly drift over the sun.
But she’d looked different. That smile that usually graced her features was gone, replaced with an unsure frown. Her eyes looked distracted, distant.
“What’s wrong?”
And then she’d done it, that’s when she’d broken his heart, and he didn’t even know why.
Jason jumped, brought back to reality with the familiar ringtone from his cell phone. Carelessly flipping it open, he read the caller ID. It was Kathy.

When Barty finally came back from Venezuela to switch with his clone, he found Betty to be all alone in the kitchen, sipping coffee silently.
“I knew you’d be back eventually,” she said, an evil smile on her face. “I’ve been waiting weeks for you.”
“Wh-what?”
Betty stood up, grabbing a pot and hitting him over the head with it.
“SO  THERE !” she shouted, kicking his lifeless body.

I was allowed to leave the hospital after the police had finished questioning me. I had a stupid-looking bandage tied around my head where it’d been sliced open, and I’d gotten some stitches, I don’t remember how many.
My mom was looking worse than I was. She’d insisted on driving, even when I’d volunteered to.
I guess after her son received a concussion, she had a reason to feel a little overprotective.
She was pale, and looked like she was about to puke. “Harvey, we need to talk about this,” she said, putting one arm against the window to lean her head against.
Her fist punched into her cheek, her hair pushed up with her knuckles.. this was the sign that she was stressed.
“Okay, what is it?”
“You didn’t really start that fight, did you?”
“No. I didn’t.”
She sighed. “I believe you. But this is going to get worse. They’re not going to let you off the hook. You have to behave yourself for a while, be a good kid.”
“I am a good kid.” I laughed. “But why are you saying this?”

“Where is she? Why did I miss my chance to meet her? God damn it I’m stupid!” Fred said hitting himself on the head.
This behavior has been going on for the last few days. Fred has been depressed that he missed his chance with the beautiful brunnet. She’s all that he could think about. Along with depression Fred also gets really angry when he thinks of his personal defeat..
“Wow this needle killer has been very active lately,” Sharey stated.
“Yeah it’s a scary thought that there’s a gut like that in  NYC ,” Betty said
“It says here that he usually strikes between ten p.m. and 4 a.m.” Sherry said
“Hey Sheary don’t you work the night shift, and walk to work?” Betty asked
“Yeah so what’s the big deal?”Sharey pondered
“Well aren’t you scared that you might get attacked?” Betty wondered
“No I’m not that scared he’s probably going to get caught soon,” Sheary said.
“Oh okay good confindence. Hey did you change your hair color?” Betty asked
“No it’s still brunnet,” Sheary exclaimed.

In public.” Ash looked mortified. Jerry looked down at her and laughed. He couldn’t help himself. “What’s so funny?” Ash demanded.“You!” Jerry hugged her. “You just got grape juice all over you, dumped coffee all over an evil cheerleader and convinced me not to buy the most awesome pair of pants I’ve ever seen! And you’re worried that you’re crying in public!” “Oh, well…” Jerry took Ash back to the car and drove her home. They were both smiling now. Well, until Ash remembered their previous conversation about the school dance.

Why was everyone making such a big deal out of this stupid fight. That’s all it was. A stupid fight.
The police didn’t make any sense at all. My mom usually didn’t freak out this much over things like this.
There was something about it that I didn’t know yet. “What is it?” I asked.
“Kelsie.. really hurt Phoebe.” She stared straight ahead. “If it really was Kelsie.”
“What do you mean? It was just a scar..”
“No.. you really were out for a while, weren’t you?” She looked over at me, as if to make completely sure I was all right. “Phoebe’s.. dead.”
I laughed, hard. So hard that I kind of snorted at the end. “I saw her when I woke up, Mom. She was okay.” I snorted a couple more times.
She stared at me again; we were at a red light. Furrowing her brow, she averted her stare to the street, shoving her hand against her face again. “I don’t know what you were seeing, Harvey.”
I stopped laughing. “I was out! How can they think that I did it?!”
“They have reasons…”

I lunged first for the man about to take Danny’s vampire genes out of him, snarling so loudly it woke Jakob up. Next I freed Jake, knowing we could work together on this. I became pack leader ultimately.
Then we both turned to kill them all. Danny struggled once more before I ripped him free of his bindings, and together we lunged to Edward. While he and I freed Edward, Jakob and Sawyer were busy tearing apart the scientists. Now all my friends were free except Nick.
I howled wildly, leaping out the door and crashing into an armed guard. Instantly I was shot down. My eyes glazed over, and I was burning again, and the last thing I saw was the man’s sneering face as he threw me carelessly over his shoulder adn began to walk away, while ordering the rest of his patrol to enter and deal with my friends.

I threw my head back. “Like what?“
“Well, Harvey, there weren’t as many ‘innocent bystanders’ as you said there were. The only reliable witnesses were Phoebe, Kelsie, you, a kid named John, some other kid..” She threw her hands up furiously. “They think you faked it.”
“Why would they think I hit my head against a table on purpose?”
“Kelsie denies it.”
“Kelsie,” I spat out.
My ex was now framing me. Wonderful how these things work out, isn’t it?
