<p>I just heard about this bill by La Seur
<\p>

<p>ABX1 70 attempts to criminalize acts of unregulated generators if they 
perform maintenance at times other than the California Public Utilities 
Commission requires. Further, the commission is required to allow scheduled 
maintenance of only one generator at a time. 
So, with 500 generators in the state, just how  many years would it take to 
complete one round of maintenance?  Also, please note it does not apply to 
munis.
