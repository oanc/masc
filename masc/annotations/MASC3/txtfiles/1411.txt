Mama stepped out to see what all the fuss was about. Her keen eyes spotted her wet and bedraggled daughter and immediately she was furious. “Rosie! Just what have you been up to?” she hissed as she came to claim her daughter.“I wanted to be like Peter, so I went sailing,” Rosie said.“Would you care to explain?” asked Mama primly.“Excuse me, ma’am,” said Rosie’s savior. “But I can explain what happened.” “And just who are you?” snapped Mama.“The man as fished your daughter out of the river. Seems she’d got it in her head to use a board and a bit o’ fabric for a sailin’ boat.” “Rose Maria King! Is this true?” Mama had her dangerous face on, so Rosie nodded without a word of explanation.“Then I must thank you with all my heart,” Mama said to the man who’d saved Rosie. “Won’t you come in?” ”’Deed, I will, ma’am, if it please you.” The man doffed his cap. “M’name is Jackson Smith.” Suddenly Mama seemed to realized something. “That was my fabric you used, wasn’t it, Rosie?” Rosie had to say yes.

Rosie was sent to her room without dinner while Mama invited Mr. Smith for tea. Rosie didn’t mind, so much, as she was tired, but every time she lay down she felt the water under her again, dragging at her. She gave up in disgust just as the sky was going gray-blue. Papa came home not much later, when Rosie’s stomach was starting to growl. Rosie could tell when Mama had explained it to Papa because there was a terrific row. Mama yelled that it was Papa’s stories that had made Rosie do such a foolish thing and Papa replied that Rosie was entitled to make her own foolish mistakes and then Mama started in on Papa for being too soft on Rosie. Rosie finally put her covers over her head and hummed loudly; she hated to hear Mama and Papa fighting. It always made her feel so guilty. Without her, she sometimes thought, Papa and Mama would always be happy together. Later, when Rosie had taken to staring out the window, Papa brought up a bit of food, saying, “Adventures, even bad ones, whet one’s appetite.”

Emmett and I skipped first period and hid out behind the gym but I was wishing for Cameron.
"We need to talk."? He hissed. He placed a big hand on each of my shoulders, pinning me back.
"Do you have to do that for us to talk? Let go."? I whispered viciously, eyes narrowing.
"What? Did you forget about our agreement or something? I did something for you and you gotta do something for me."?
"This isn't the something I had in mind."?
"Unless of course you want me to tell the whole school what I did for you. No one would expect you to"”"?
"Okay!"? I cut him off. "I get it but no one's around us. You can let go of me. And I'm still mad at you. So you're pushing it."?
"Why you mad, baby?"? he kissed my lips once and then again.

"What the hell was your problem yesterday?!” I screamed in Emmett’s face. “You didn't have to hurt me in front of all those people. My face is still swollen."? I didn't have the freedom to move my hands to show him so I was glaring intensely.
"I know, baby."? he kissed me again. Ugh, stop it! Stop trying to make up with your kisses. That hurts worse. "But its all about keeping face."?
"Emmett, when you dropped me off at home, I had to make up some excuse for my mom! Don't ever make me do that to her again! As a matter of fact, don’t you ever fucking hit me again!"?
"No promises. I already do what I can for you."? he stared at me, trying to get the point across. Yes, I understood. Okay?
I snorted and rolled my eyes though. "Can we just get to class? I already missed Bio."?
"That was part of the point."? he snapped before walking away from me.

I have another challenge for my fellow ficleteers. Here it is.
Okay, so the first story I ever published on this site was Chapter 1 of Residing Dreams. It is now many many chapters long, and it is quite a lengthy series. But now I challenge you to write your own sequel to my first chapter of Residing Dreams. I will post it as a sequel to this ficlet, which is titled, “Residing Dreams Continuation Challenge.” You can write one or several stories as sequels to Chapter 1 of Residing Dreams. They can go off in any direction, as long as they are related to chapter 1 of Residing Dreams. I decided to come up with this challenge because I thought it would be neat to see what you guys could come up with. There are some really awesome writers on this site, and so I tell you all:
Write on, fellow ficleteers, write on!

It was dark and secretive, mystery dwelling in the twinkling sky, the night I met him. Or, rather, the night I found him. The night we found each other.
I hadn’t been able to fall asleep, and I wasn’t the only one who was still awake in the dead, as well as life, of night. I tossed and turned in my queen-sized bed; residing in a room that looked like it was a bedchamber in a fancy hotel. Though, in reality, I wasn’t staying in a hotel at all.
I was residing in somebody’s house, or mansion, if you will.
As I look back on it all, in spite of everything, that seems to be the least significant detail in my memory. That is, when I compared it to what I discovered in my stay at the upscale yet old-fashioned dwelling. For where you go on this journey called life is far less important than whom you meet while living it. That was one thing I learned that summer, as well as more than I could’ve ever imagined in my wildest dreams.

I stare into his eyes and he stares into mine. He puts his hand on my cheek and I feel a bolt of feelings. Blood rushes to my face and butterflies fill my stomach. I lean my head on his hand and just take in the feeling. We come even closer and he brushes back my hair. My heart pounds out of my chest as I keep gasping for air. I put my hand on the back of his neck, feeling another bolt as I run my hand threw his hair. I close my eyes and our lips are about a centimeter from each other. My eyes open as "love story"? plays on my phone. I lean back in anger as the moment is lost. Chris huffs in disappointment. I check my phone, its Edwin.

Having woken myself at the crack-of-dawn, I gazed at the beautiful morning sky, frosted by the ice along my window. My Orchids had reached their peak. Their blossoms glistening within their light blanket of fallen snowflakes, while sprinkling a pastel pink through the white cover. The robins were out with their freshly-hatched offspring, singing winter melodies as they danced among the crisp air. But, however breathtaking, my heart wasn’t touched the way it used to be. My heart normally sang with the robins, but instead it remained silent, restless, as if aching for something new. I walked into the kitchen, pouring myself a cup of coffee, when Richard walked in. “Good Morning, Riana,” he said softly. I turned in an automatic response and thoughtfully looked at him. He had changed since we had met. His hair had lightened, and his eyes had darkened, but he had also changed in a less physical way. He continually grew more solitary and confined, losing the spontaneity he used to possess. “Good Morning.”

It seemed as if our relationship had dwindled, like a puzzle divided by the missing center piece. I wanted to change that this Christmas. After all, doesn’t everyone refer to it as the season of love? I wanted to bring back all the feelings we had not so long ago for each other. Feelings we thought we were so full of, it would overflow our souls, a beautiful Christmas 5 years ago.
“Today is so droll, Aunt Lily.” I whined. “Really, dear, you should get out more. The world is full of surprises,” she replied with a twinkle of mischief in her eyes. The look implied she knew something, a secret or plan, and that was rarely ever good. The last time I had come to England to spend Christmas with her, she had several boys come over. Not saying I didn’t like them, I rather adored them, but I would rather find my own fiance. Which I had told her several times. My Aunt Lily, no matter how much I love her, annoyed me with her passion for matchmaking. “What are you up to exactly, Auntie?”

“What are you about, boy?” challenged the colonel.
“I’ve come to fight. It’s my country too!” declared the daring young man. The assembled riders sniggered.
“Don’t be daft. Ye cannot ride into battle on that…that…”
“It’s a draft horse, sir, plenty strong and fast too.” More giggles rippled through the ranks.
“Look…what’s yer name, lad?”
“Yerfle Pons of the Grennich.”
The colonel wrinkled his rouged nose, “Bleh, rather common, boring name, isn’t it?”
“Doesn’t mean I can’t fight.”
“Look, don’t you see the difference. What are we all riding?”
Yerfle sighed, “Unicorns, I know. But Fletsy here…”
“Who?”
“Fletsy, my horse. He’s just as fast as any unicorn and stronger, better for battle!” The riders really burst out laughing at that.
As they charged off, the colonel yelled back, “He’s just too drab for battle!” And the warfaring host rode on in their glittering sequened armor, pastel pendants waving.
Shoulders slumped, Yerfle could only bemoan, “My country has the gayest army ever.”

The faeries, gnomes, elves, nymphs and elementals had gathered at Mother Nature’s door. Every creature of legend or myth had received a summons just as the first hint of the tilt of the earth had been felt. Autumn was serious business in Mother Nature’s eyes and everyone should be involved.
Silence spread through the excited crowd as her door creaked open and she stepped out. Everyone and everything bowed to her and waited for instruction.
“My children,” she smiled, “the time has come again to bathe the lands with the warming hues of Autumn. Touch every leaf of every tree, large and small. Lay your magic upon the earth and lend the amber, gold, russet, orange and even the maroon, to the humans for their enjoyment as they gaze at the horizon. Leave it breathtaking and even captivating. I want to be amazed.”
Mother Nature closed her eyes and tilted her head back ever so slightly. The wind rustled (as it would through leaves) from head to toe, she was washed in shades of gold, orange and brown.

"Sure. I think there is a DQ down the road from here"¦"? I say.
He takes me there in the Cadillac. Inside, I order a Brownie Earthquake and Edwin gets a Brownie Batter blizzard. We take our ice cream and eat it outside.
"Oh, that looks really good!"? I say, eyeing his ice cream.
"Wanna try?"? He offers.
"Sure."? I say. He dips his spoon in, gets a good sized bite, and then he feeds it to me. "Mmm! That is good."?
"Mind if I try yours?"? He asks. I shake my head and then get some brownie, ice cream and hot fudge on my spoon and feed it to him. "Oh, that's good too!"?
I laugh and nod, enjoying more of my ice cream. Soon, our ice cream is gone and we head home. I'm surprised to realize I actually had a lot of fun on our date.
