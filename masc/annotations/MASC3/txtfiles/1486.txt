NO. No part of it is fun, or right, or good.
I… don’t like getting crushed over and over and over. I don’t like doing that to myself.
Wanting something so bad…. I hate myself for it.
I hate making myself vulnerable to you. I hate that you can do this to me.
I hate that I want you to help me. I wish I could be like I used to be… just resenting any kind of help in any way.
Like I said, it’s just easier not to feel.
You have the ability to hurt me without trying… because of the stupid stories. Because you just can.
The stories… make everything harder. The stories give me false hope. Hope is good… but not for this. Not at all.
The stories are what I wish for… the stories are what I know will never happen. The stories are just unreal.
I have to stop living in the stories now.
I hate being vulnerable. You make me vulnerable. But I don’t hate you. Maybe that would be easier. But, I don’t. I just… hate what you do to me. I don’t want to be that kind of person.

I raised my legs up and over the balconey until I was on the other side, holding on tightly. It kind of made me think of that scene from Titanic, you know the one where Jack and Rose first meet. “You’ll be perfectly fine. I’m right here.” Brent called.
I took a deep breath and jumped off, a scream bubbling out of me on the way down.
But Brent caught me, just like he said, “That wasn’t so hard now was it?” He smiled dazzingly and I was lost…until I heard my front door open, “Oh my God, hide!” I tore (reluctantly) from Brent’s warm arms and hid in the bushes that lined my house. “Jameson!” I heard my mom cry, “Jameso-you!” My mom hissed while pointing at Brent, “What have you done with my daughter?!”
“Nothing.”
“You damn well did something you son of a bitch. Now. What. Did. You. Do. To. Her?!”
Brent shrugged, “I haven’t seen your daughter in nine years, and now you’re saying I’ve done something to her?”

Because I have a past,Because I have been close to the edge,Because I have made mistakes,Because I probably just made one,Without meaning to. Do not assume. Do not. You don’t get to label me,When you do not know,Or even care to. Because you have only known one side of me. The side that survived,Not the side that died. Not the side that I hide.

“Shut up. You have been an issue to my family for years. You are a failure,” My mother spat on the ground and slammed the door shut, the sound making me wince. I immediatly rushed to Brent’s side, as if he was a magnet, “Brent I’m so sorry about my mother. She’s a total bitch.”
“Aww don’t say that about your mother. And I’m fine. Totally used to it by now,” He words didn’t read true in his eyes, I could tell. He began twisting his lip ring back and forth with his tongue, seeming to try and focus on that more than me.
After a minute or two he turned back to me, smiling, “Ready to go now?”
I smiled big, “Of course.”
I recalled of back when my family owned our small yacht. It was a sailboat, and I loved it dearly. But like most things I have loved, my mother took it away, saying we didn’t have the money for it. Which I knew was a lie. Only our money could afford my mother’s terrible clothing bill.

I’ve never understood stairs for what they are. I know they save space, but isn’t it easier to just go up a vertical incline? Easier for everyone, old people and handicapped?
I go down the rather scary vertical stairs to reach the main floor to exit the train. I’m ready to start moving again. The doors slide open, and tons of people wait for their loved ones.
It is so beautiful, watching a person’s face light up when they see someone that they completely love. But it’s the hardest thing in the world when you realize you have no one to hug.
I walk down the platform and onto a vertical incline that leads into the station. It is so much easier. I grab a pamphlet advertising that a nearby diner has the best blueberry pancakes in the world.
At that moment. At that second, it happened. I figured it out.

We both liked to spend time with each other, and the remaining days of summer were absorbed with full felicity.
The Chrysanthemum residence seemed happier as well, and the gloom diminished. The staff were vaguely pleased that Casimir and I had become good friends. Something about him had changed. He had a sort of glow about him, and he smiled a lot more. He didn’t seem to get sick as much, and it was as if he had finally been set free, like a prisoner in chains or a dove in a cage.
One night, we decided to go outside and look at the stars. The last time we had seen the stars together, it had been through a window. Now, on a large blanket were two lawn chairs, along with Casimir’s telescope. He had probably set it up earlier that day and wanted to surprise me. We sat close together, and Casimir held my hand. The stars twinkled above us, and the moon could be seen as clear as day.

"You know, some people say that the sky holds secrets. Astronomers and fortune tellers, those kinds of people. To be honest, I'm not really sure, but I think I believe it's true. I mean, God created the world, including all the skies and heavens. And I reckon He holds the secrets to the universe. So since the distant stars and galaxies are His making, and most of them are far beyond what humans could ever explore, then they must hold some kind of hidden truths and foretelling,"? Casimir mused.
"Mm. That's a good point. But perhaps there are some things that we will never know. Things that we'll never quite figure out, not even when we're angels residing in heaven and roaming the skies. But if we're truly lucky, then we'll figure out the stuff that really matters. Like who we really are, what we have to give, and how much of ourselves we are willing to give to the world.

And perhaps there comes a point in our lives when we start to realize who really matters, who never did, and who always will. I guess now I see that all of those kids who used to make fun of my father didn't really have much to them. They were cruel and spiteful and lost, that's all. But the people who always stayed by my side even when things got tough, they're the ones who mean the most to me. They aren't perfect either, but they do the best they can, and their hearts are in the right place,"? I said.
"Essie, sometimes I think that we're like night and day. You're the sun, and I'm the moon. Maybe we're thought to be different and opposites, but when you really think about it, the two coexist peacefully. When there's night there's night and when there's day there's day. Nights and days both make up weeks and months and years. Time passes with both of them. One wouldn't be quite the same without the other.

What would life be like if it never got dark out, or the sun never came up? Space may have its mysteries; it goes on and on like life and time. But so be it,"? Casimir commented thoughtfully. "Well, science aside, I see it this way. The glow of the moon illuminates hidden brightness upon the sun. I reckon that's one of the secrets of the universe,"? I whispered. Casimir contemplated my words for a moment. "Well, I declare! You're quite the poet,"? he said, grinning. "We're each other's sunshine. It's as simple as that,"? I murmured. We held each other as close as we dared, dwelling in the light of the moon.

On a sunny morning in the beginning of September, I was overjoyed when three letters came in the mail. One of them was from Dad, which was filled with loving words. He was really missing me, and he was counting the days until I would come home. He sent me a picture of himself, standing in front of our house. He had on a pink shirt.
The other letters were from January and, to my surprise, McKenna. January said that she was looking forward to me coming back. She asked how Casimir was doing, and if I had deemed going to London to be a valuable life experience that expanded my horizon. January also brought news that her dog had just given birth to six puppies. She had named one after me.
What McKenna wrote was, in so many words, utterly moving. I cried a little bit when I read her letter, and I felt the abundant gratitude and peace that went along with redemption.

“What do you want,”she growled.
“bathroom?”I replied, confused as to why she was being so rude.
“Whatever,”she mumbled pushing past me, knocking me into the wall.

“Oh sorry, I don’t speak loser,”she yelled back.
What was she? five?who says that, and why was she acting like this…we used to be bestfriends.
I finished up in the bathroom and walked back out on the dance floor to get my things.

Her letter said:
Dear Essie,
Wow! It seems like forever since we last talked. Time goes by so fast, doesn’t it? Firstly, I just want to say that I’m so sorry I haven’t written or called sooner. My life has just been…well, really complicated. But I’ll talk about that later. Right now, I want to know how you are. Did you have a good summer? I hope you had a lot of fun at camp. Even though we haven’t seen each other in a while, I still want you to know how much you mean to me as a friend. We’ve been soul sisters since 1st grade, and you were to me, as to many people, a ray of sunshine. I know that I haven’t been the best friend that I should be, and I sincerely apologize for this. I know you have been through some storms this year, and I wish I had been more of a shoulder to cry on. After all, you were always there for me. I wish I made it easier for you to confide in me. We could’ve really helped each other sort things out.

“You having fun up there Jamie?” Brent cried. He was towards the stern of the boat. I felt my face heat up with embarressment. I watched at his made his way towards the front where I stood, “If you like the air so much you can sit up there.” And Brent pointed towards the one sail, where on the top a crow’s nest sort of thing sat. My eyes lit up at the sight of it, “I can go up there?”
“Sure.” He barely finished the word for me to begin rushing up the rope ladder that led towards the crow’s nest.

The point is, life hasn’t been easy for me either. You see, I don’t really know how to tell you this, but… my parents recently got a divorce. They’ve been separated for about a month or so, and I think I could see it coming. I knew something had changed this year. Things weren’t the same around the house and sometimes at night, I could hear them fighting. They didn’t raise their voices much, but once in a while they did. The worst part was probably when they didn’t talk to each other at all. My mom and dad would give each other the silent treatment for days. Sometimes I wished that I could have a family more like yours. Even though it’s just you and your dad, you both seem so happy and contented. Your father is a great man, and I’d love it if he were my dad. I will never understand how a couple could just stop loving each other. I’ve seen wedding pictures of my mom and dad, as well as photos of them after that. Back then, they looked like they were truly in love.

My mom and dad aren’t married anymore, and I get the impression that they would rather be complete strangers than husband and wife. And it’s really hard to deal with. But I’m thankful that you’re my friend. If you have anything on your mind or have something to say, then I promise, I’ll listen. It’s the least I can do for you after all you’ve done for me.

I felt as if I had just set sail upon the boat of compassion and friendship, and I was feeling the wind blowing me in the right direction. Finally, I understood McKenna. I realized that our friendship wasn’t diminished or over, and that the reason she hadn’t been the same was because of something that wasn’t either of our faults. I had never known much about divorce, but I could understand where McKenna was coming from. No family would ever be perfect or completely normal, and everything in life would have its quirks. There was an outpouring of compassion from her letter to my heart which I perceived with great surprise. We would find a way to confide in each other, just as Casimir and I had. Though life didn’t always turn out the way we wanted or expected it to be, it always had a way of working out in the end.

I’ve never liked labels. I’ve never understood how people think they have the right to give a name for what a person is, especially if it is cruel. All these labels result in pressures to be someone that we might not want to be.
I’m not talking about a job title, I’m talking about calling a person, ugly, fat, pretty, skinny, slut, whore, idiot, freak, fag, etc. This world has become so based off of being the fittest, most beautiful person you can be. It is just so unethical. It’s unhealthy.
These labels are what forces teens to become anorexic, drug addicts, drunk, depressed. I know, “But one silly little word can’t destroy a life.” Maybe, it starts with a word, but what happens when people keep saying it?
What happens when you start to believe it?

The sight all the way up there was breathtaking. I was able to see for miles along the ocean. And the wind was strong enough to knock the air out of me, but I loved it all the same.
“You like it?” I was slightly surprised to see Brent sitting right beside me, his close proximity making me unable to breath. The sun shone on his natural red hair beautifully. I managed to tear my eyes away from him to say, “Like it? I love it. It’s completely-”
“Breathtaking? I know.” It was silent for a bit as we took in the beauty. I resisted turning to look at him for a long time…well it was really only around 2 minutes until I turned to take in his beauty. His green eyes shone with complete joy; he loved his boat as much as I loved mine. Then a random though came to mind, “Brent,” I breathed, “Why did you start talking to me anyway?”
This left him speechless for a second, “I think it was your eyes. They’re filled with such kindness that they just…drew me in.” My jaw dropped, but Brent wasn’t finished yet.

“Your eyes were filled with such kindness…and yet fear at the same time when I first saw you after all those years. I had the sudden desire to clear all the fear from them.” My heart thudded uncontrollably from Brent’s words. He laughed, “And it seems like I’m doing a pretty good job.” I smiled and added my laugh in. Then Brent pushed my bang from my face and tucked the ends behind my ear, his touch seeming to electrocute me. He then leaned in close, eyes transfixed to mine. I felt dizzy, being unable to breath. He was so close, I could feel his breath on my face. He smiled, “Yep the fear is gone.”
“Well that’s good.” I whispered. From the close distance I saw light boyish freckles dot across Brent’s nose and cheekbones. The freckles were suddenly surrounded by blush, “So that’s why I wanted to talk to you. Plus…I missed you.”
“You know I could’ve changed in those nine years. Could’ve become like my mother.” I felt my heart darken at the sound of that word.

Brent pulled his face even closer to mine as he whispered, “You’re afraid of her. Why would you become what you fear?” I closed my eyes then. All of this, the butterfiles in my stomach, what Brent was saying to me, the very scent of him, was making me dizzy.
I knew what was going to happen soon. I could sense it in the atmosphere, “Brent,” I managed to form that word. He then gently pressed his lips to mine and what seemed like a bolt of lightning shot through me from his touch. I fell limp, unabled to move, barely able to breath. Brent stopped then, much to my disappointment, astonishment in his eyes as he gasped, “I think we should get down from here.”
I could barely make it down the rope ladder, with my dizziness from Brent kissing me plus the swaying of the boat.

I shot up from my seat and cried, “Oh my God she is going to kill me Brent! Why did I agree to go?! She’s going to kill me!”

I sobbed into his chest, “Okay.”
“Now relax, you’re safe.” He stroked my hair, now falling out of my ponytail. His touch made my heart skip a beat over and over again, “Now I’m going to let go of you to drive home? Will you be okay?”

“Where the hell were you?!” My mother shrieked, “I looked in your room to find you gone. Did that boy kidnap you?”
I decided to play it stupid, “What boy?”
Then she slapped me, hard, “You know damn well what boy,” She grabbed my head in her hand and dragged me to the balconey to point at Brent finishing with his boat, “That boy,” she hissed, “Did he kidnap you?”
“No,” I stated definatly. Mother pulled my hair back, making me gasp in pain, “Don’t try to protect him just for his pretty face, he’s nothing but a bad seed. Worthless.” I felt my anger rise from her calling Brent worthless.

“Well-you-me-”
“Answer. The. Damn. Question. Jameson.”
“Yes,” I squeaked. My mother then, calmly, grabbed a handful of my hair. She then threw me to the ground, only she didn’t let go of her grip. So a big handful of my hair was ripped out. Mother dropped it on the ground beside where I fell, walked out the door, locking it from the outside.
I slowly crawled to the door leading to the balconey, sobbing quietly while holding that handful of my hair.
“Brent…” I quietly whispered, “Help me. I hurt.”
