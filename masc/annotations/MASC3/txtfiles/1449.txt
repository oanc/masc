‘There’s this obsession I have. It’s probably really unhealthy, but I probably don’t care. I like to light candles and test how long my finger can stay over the flame. I used to start off really slow. I would move my finger through the flame quickly at first then slowly ease my way up to keeping it there. One time, I held my finger there too long and I sat there and watched it blister. It was beautiful, so I kept it there. Now I have a scar because I kept picking at the scab. I figured I wouldn’t be able to ever keep my finger over the flame that long again unless I did serious nerve damage. So now, I always use that finger because there is a scar and I don’t feel anything. I wish everything was that way.’ I decided that was a good ice breaker. If he didn’t like that about me, I could leave without looking back.

I was in a bed, I knew that much. Skyler was next to me. ‘Nevada, maybe, and I don’t know’ he said to me. ‘Since when do you read minds?’ He laughed. I was serious.‘Since you started waking up with ‘where are we and how long have we been here?’ every morning.’‘oh.’ I rolled over and went back to bed, making a mental note in my head to make sure that next time I woke up I would remember where I was.

Somehow, a couple months had passed. I was either unconscious or unaware.
The only thing I know is that I’m at the cemetery, tracing people’s names with my fingertips. ‘Everyone has a story, you know’ ‘you know all these people?’ Skyler was so naïve, it was comical.‘No.. a few, but not all. But look here, Greg Sanderlin. He was born in 1936, married in 1957, only 21. His wife, Emily. She died only two months after him in 1997. They were married 40 years. He probably died before their anniversary though. Right when your life is about to get going, age 21, fresh and clean, he married his highschool sweet heart. They knew eachother for a long time. Dated all through highschool, snuck out on the weekends, went to college together. Their first true love, and only true love. He died of a heart attack. She died two months later of a broken life.’‘you mean heart? she died of a broken heart.’

Earnestly Charles looked through his papers, 7 sheets of card stock with one word on each. Each had a color scribbled below the word, and most had little doodles.
“Whatcha doin, Charlie?”
“Hmm? Oh, I’m picking a sin.”
After a slight pause, Ellen clarified, “You’re picking a sin?”
“Yeah. You know, one of the 7 deadly ones.”
“Um, sure, figured that one out. Do you have to write a paper or…” She left the sentence dangling for him to finish.
He obliged, “I’m deciding which one to work on.”
Another pause, then, “Charlie, that’s sweet and all, but you’re, like, one of the most saintly guys I know.”
Sighing under the library’s dim, yellow light, he conceded, “I know. That’s why I’m picking one to work on.”
“But you’re already saintly. Why do you need to work…unless…oh jeez, Charlie!”
“What?”
“They aren’t in a list to pick one to start doing!”
“Why not? What if I’m tired of being saintly? It’s not as fun as you might think.”

After the hats song and the applause died down Professor McGonagall stood up and said,”When I call your name come up here and sit in the stool,then I shall put the hat on your head and you will go to the house you are placed in.” With that she began at th top of the list. “Andrews, Kyle…Andrews,Kyle.” A nervous looking brunette boy walked up and sat down. Before the hat was even on his head the hat screamed, “HUFFLEPUFF!” The hufflepuff table exploded into cheers and hollors as their newest hufflepuff joined them. “RAVENCLAW!” A beautiful chinese girl joined the screaming ravenclaw table.

I forced myself to wake up as soon as we reached the hospital. Theo was still holding me in his arms.
"You're awake,"? he said with surprise.
"Theo, I'm so sorry, I-"
"There's nothing to be sorry about. This is no one's fault. And what you did back there was pretty awesome."?
"Thanks. It was"¦ tiring though."?
