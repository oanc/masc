The four of us leave the house laughing. Amber and I walk past our neighbor's house.
"Why didn't we go there?"? Ashton asks, pointing towards the house we skipped.
"They're not home from work yet."? I shrug.
We go from house to house, singing and having a good time. We go to almost every house around our block. By the time we come home, our faces are flushed from laughing and the cold weather.
"You guys have fun?"? My mom asks when we walk in.
"Yep!"? Amber answers.
"Mrs. Lovedie,"? Edwin says, still laughing, and puts his arm around my shoulder. "Why didn't you ever tell me how amazing your daughters are at singing?"?
"Stop it!"? I say, blushing.
"What?!"? He says, looking offended. "I'm only saying the truth."?
"Both our daughters have always been good singers. And they both love to sing around Christmas."? My mom laughs.
"Thanks Mom"¦"? I say, laughing. "Yeah, we love it"¦ but we're not amazing!"?

“This is it,” Hector thought as he stood in front of the 5th story window of his apartment building. “She will never see me as more than a friend as long as that green eyed boy is still around.”
Hector was poised to jump out the window. It would be easier to just end it all at once. One fatal leap would end it all. He would never have to deal with these problems again.
As he climbed up into the bay window, he found himself wondering what would happen if this act didn’t kill him. What if someone or something caught him at the bottom? What if he landed on his feet or only broke a couple of bones.
He would dive head first. This would solve any potential rescue problem.
Hector unlatched the locks and stuck his head out the window. The cool autumn breeze whipped up his curly hair. He felt the sun on his face. He knew this would be the last time he would see the sun.
He took a deep breath.
Then the phone rang. It was her. “I have something to tell you. Come right away.”
And he did.

I could barely sit still.
Emma. In Ireland. Tomorrow.
“Gah! I get so excited! I haven’t seen you in so long!” I practically squealed into the phone, my head spinning.
“Yes, thank you, thank you. I’m just awesometastic, aren’t I?”
“That’s not even a word!” I said, trying to breathe through my laughter.
“Oh, no,  AIDS !”
“What?” I paused at her panicked tone.
“Did I just make you get a heart attack?! Doctor, stand by with the defibrillator!”
“Ha, ha, very funny,” I commented dryly, propping myself up on one elbow.
“And I’ll finally get to meet Mr. Sandman!”
“I’m not very sure you’ll get along…”
“Pish posh,  AIDS ! It’ll be fun anyway. How’s Mrs. McCarthy?”
I chuckled again. “Good, better than ever. She and Seamus have opened up a mead brewery.”
“They did? Well, it took them long enough. They’ve been planning on opening it since before you left Ireland!”
“I know. It seems to have caught on really well.”
“I guess I’ll see you tomorrow!”
“Ems, you don’t know how good that sounds.”

That night, I put my head down on my pillow feeling quite accomplished.
And yet, for all the elation I was feeling, I knew there was something gnawing at me.
It was Papa’s funeral.
It was happening the day after tomorrow.
I put my palms over my face, inhaling and exhaling slowly to stop myself from crying again.
When the burning in my throat had subsided, I swallowed, nearly choking at the rawness of the pain.
I reached across the nightstand, and fumbled in the drawers until I found a Strepsil. I sucked on it furiously.
The scratchiness ebbed away, eventually, and I was left with a sense of sour nostalgia.
I remembered how Mama (because she was, in all essence, my mother) used to put a cool, wet lace towel on my forehead when I had a high fever.
It always felt good, and the white fabric had smelled of home and lavender.
It was useless.
The tears pricked at the corners of my eyes, fighting their way out until they were rolling down my face.
I was back to square one.

The next morning, I awoke with something very warm and very minty in my face.
“Shcooter, off.” My voice was was muffled by his unbelievable amounts of fluff.
I dodged sluggishly out of the way just as his paws threatened to trample my face.
I got up from bed, stopping when a wave of dizziness rushed up to meet me.
I grasped the bed post, trying to steady myself and my dangerously blurry vision.
“What the bloody hell was that?” I murmured irately, blinking in an attempt to get my bearings.
I sat back down on the bed, afraid to take a step forward lest I lose my balance and fall down.
Scooter crawled into my lap, his green eyes drilling holes into me.
I swayed backwards, and stopped myself just in time; I lowered my head to the pillow again.
I didn’t feel sleepy and that was funny, because things started to go black. Little dots started to dance in front of me.
This is how it is to faint, huh?
The last thing I remembered was Scooter yowling his head off.

When it was time to dress out, Aydan’s cheeks were pink and he had sweat on his face..it kinda looks…hot…
As we head inside, Aydan gives me a playful high five and say,”Woah..your cheeks are so red!”
“Well, they do that a lot…” I blushed.
“I think it looks nice, You’re the kind of girl who doesn’t need make up to look pretty..” Aydan said sweetly.
“Awww..thanks..that’s really sweet of you, but Im not the type of girl who even likes make up.” I said
“Well, you don’t need it, I mean if I was a girl, I’d wouldn’t want to be your friend, you know ..steal all the guys..”
I laughed,”Mmm..I glad your not a girl, I like talking to you.”
He replied,”Aren’t we lucky I’m not.”
The day went by fast with Aydan, we never ran out of something to say, and Im the type of person that doesn’t talk a lot, so I was mostly listening.
I got home and just crashed on the bed and plugged in my ipod. I just couldn’t live with out it. I started listening to your call by secondhand serenade..

Raine sat down at Mrs. McCarthy’s table, bleary eyed from sleep.
The night had been long, and filled with unwanted dreams of things that he wanted to forget.
“What would ye like for breakfast?” Mrs. McCarthy asked, smiling kindly.
“Whatever’s the easiest.” Raine yawned. “I’ll eat anything.”
Just then, a very horrid sound drifted down the stairs and into that kitchen.
Aidan’s infernal cat was at it again, screaming for some reason.
Mrs. McCarthy didn’t seem perturbed, and he followed her lead until the cat continued to howl, obviously not stopping any time soon.
“I swear,” Raine grumbled, getting up from the table with an oath, “I’m going to make her throw that cat out.”
Mrs. McCarthy just smiled and shook her head as he stomped upstairs.
Raine walked down the hallway, the wood creaking only slightly under his weight, until he came to Aidan’s bedroom.
Hopefully, she’d be better than last night.
He opened the door.
“Listen, if you don’t…”
His breath hitched.
“Aidan!”

The day crawled by. My eye still ached but it was the least of my worries. what secret? What was she talking about? What is she hiding? I had to wait it off until after school. After our Bio teacher ‘talked to us after class about making out in the closet’, Anna and I agreed to meet in the library after school. After my last class I entered the library. I eyed the whole room, as if looking for Emmett or someone who’d be spying for him. No sign of anyone suspicious. I sat down at the table, pretended to read and waited for Anna. Three minutes or so after I arrived she walked in. “Hi.” She said in a whisper.“Hi. Anna, what’s going on? What is this secret?” “Shh. Cameron listen to me,” She still wispered. “You can’t talk to anyone about this.” “I won’t, I promise. I’m want to help you.” I whispered back. What could she be hiding? Will I judge her on this secret? My heart pounded. Her head lowered, as if in shame.“OK,” she said. “I’ll tell you…”

“Ding dong,” the doorbell rang. There was no answer so Leslie rang it again.“Oh, hi Leslie,” her neighbor hastilly answered. She was acting kind of suspicious, looking all around her like she had something to hide… “Ummm…Karli’s at a friend house right now. Sorry,” she told Leslie.“Actually, Mrs. Harper, I came because my mom is gone and…” “You came to look for her? I haven’t seen her.” she cut her off. “Actually…I was wondering if I could come in because I’m a little bit scared, she didn’t answer her cell phone. “Well…ummm…I was actually…just going to the mall,” she obviously came up with an excuse for why I couldn’t enter. And creepiest of all, she was still doing that weird, suspicious, look-all-around-her thing…but Leslie wasn’t about to question her…”Ok. I guess I’ll just go over to Ms. Lewis’ house.” Leslie sadly answered. Before she even finished her sentence, her neighbor shut the door in her face.“Well, that was weird!” she said aloud to herself.

I grabbed Cameron’s hand, pulled him into a corner and began talking. "I got raped at a party toward the end of summer, okay? The guy was … amazing. I had just met him the day before and then he invited me to the party. I got drunk and he did stuff. Weeks later, I was pregnant and I asked "¦ a "¦ another guy to drive me somewhere. He didn't ask anything just got me an abortion."?
Cameron cut me off. "Why the hell did you get Emmett to drive you?!"?
"Shhhh! After that, Emmett and I were always together. We were the couple to be until he started hitting me. Now, his excuse is that if I go for anyone else, he'll tell everyone what happened."?
I finished, waiting for Cameron to reply. When he didn't, I had to look up at his face. He was staring at me intently, and then asked bluntly, "Who "¦ raped you?"?
I shrugged and Cameron growled.
"You know who it was, dammit. Who?"? He pulled at his hair. "Please "¦ please don't tell me it was him."?
The tears that were threatening me finally spilled over. "But it was."?

The tears on Anna’s cheeks slid to the corners of her fine lips. I hung my head with anger. Frustration filled me and my first instinct was to hunt Emmett down and rip his spine out. Logic took over, finally. I took a deep breath.“Anna. You have to know that what you just told me changes everything.” “How? You think I’m a horrible person!” She blurted.“No, I don’t. That’s not it. This is serious. You’re 17 years old. What Emmett has done is wrong in so many ways.” “We Can’t do anything about it! He’ll blackmail me!” I had to calm her down. “Anna listen to me!” I said in a loud whisper. She jumped. That’s not gonna do it. I slowed down. “It’s all going to work out. It’ll be alright. But we have to work together.” I looked into her eyes. She finally calmed a bit. My words brought her back. “I’m not gonna just abandon you on this. I’m too involved now.” I put my hand on her cheek, whiped a tear, and slid my fingers softly to her chin. “I am.” i whispered slowly, then pressed my lips against hers.

I stayed silent..one thing I learned while being around her is to never argue with her.
She just doesn’t get it. I can figure everyone else out except him..What did he have to hide? He could be one of the most popular people in the whole school, he could be going out with Juliana Moore!
Why was he out of the crowd, he intrigued me..so much.
He just seemed so…lifeless..so closed off..so..broken…
Maryella doesn’t seem to notice Im off to analyzing people in my head…
She’s not very observant..Juliana comes around to …me…wait..????
“Hey, I love your hair! Its sooooo pretty..!” Her voice is so….one word for it might be Slutty?
Not to be mean..but the atmosphere around her was so..fabricated…

I tried to keep my composer under this blindfold when I was really having a breakdown. I mean, he’s already killed two people, plus Dellin wasn’t sounding so hot. “So please Bree, tell us about yourself.” Er? What point is he trying to get at? “Uhm…okay. My name is Bree Grenhil. I’m 15-”
“That’s not what I’m talking about,” Cody hissed. I wandered through his mind…trying to search for something…then I hit a brick wall, leaving me shocked. My conscience beat against it mercilessly, but to no avail.
I can’t take it anymore. I give up. I heard Dellin think. “Dellin don’t give up yet,” I encouraged. Cody groaned, “Guess I have to do everything,” he paused and I heard the click of a gun being loaded. The gun was fired, and the shrieking went off in my head. He shot Dellin again, killing him. In the background of the painful scream I heard the words, “Bree Grenhil is telepathic ladies and gentleman.”
I didn’t focus on that. I focused on Dellin’s last thought:
Finally the pain has ended.

While I was about to leave, I remembered that Aydan left a question unanswered…Why brown?
It may have seemed like a trivial question..but it was driving me crazy not knowing something…to satisfy myself, I’d text him later.
Why didn’t he answer the damn question?
You sound paranoid..
Shut up! What do you know?
Um..do you hear yourself?
All I hear is you!
I’m just going to leave….
Fine!
While I was arguing with myself, I didn’t notice that I was on the field..
“Hey Peyton!” somebody yelled
“Huh? Oh ya..hey….er..” I glanced to see who it was. “Stevie! ” (btw, its a girl..real name is samantha but stevie sounds way better, right?)
“Hey , what’s up..you seem distracted.” She said
“Um..really..I don’t know..guess Im just ….distracted…” I replied.
Stevie decided not to push it further..but I think I tipped her off the edge when the coach was yelling at us and I was just smiling like a physco into space…

When Cameron kissed me it felt like all of my problems were solved. He cradled my chin softly"”not violent like Emmett"”and his tongue grazed the top of my mouth. I smiled as he kissed me and then I grabbed his face and kissed him back.
Suddenly, someone shoved Cameron, hard. He caught himself and looked into the face of the quarterback, Dash.
"Dammit, Anna. Come on!"? Dash barked at me and I seethed. "What? You didn't hear me?!"?
"I'm not going anywhere, Dash."? He rolled his eyes and shoved Cameron again. “Stop that!”
"Anna, I'm so not afraid to pick you up. I'd actually enjoy it. I haven't gotta much ass lately."? I gaped at him and he ignored it. Then, his voice turned sad and he closed his eyes. "Just "¦ come on, okay? I’m not afraid to hurt you either."?
"You wouldn’t dare. You’re not some beast like Emmett. You just work for him, Dash."?
"Just come on then. I didn’t wanna hurt you anyway."? When I didn’t move, Dash grabbed my waist just as Cameron punched him.
"Keep your hands off her!"? Cameron growled.

I’m sure that they’re inside and I will find them I don’t leave people behind especially not friends!!” Joe grabbed her by the arm and kissed her with more passion than ever. “Fine then let’s find them.” Anne ran up the stairs across from the gym, they were the only ones still up. When she got up the stairs she saw his friends Kyle and Anthony laing on the ground. “Come on you  LOSERS !! get off the ground and lets go!!!” Anthony was the first to wake up, “Anne? Is that you?” “YES!!YES!! It’s me,it’s me.” He stood up and grabbed Kyles arm, Anne grabbed Kyle’s other arm and they helped him down the steps. They ran out the door with Joe running slowly behind them.

The “What the hell” thing? Was he copying me? I didnt ask this time, trying not to break the silence I tried so hard to keep. But I didnt break it..Jueli did. “Why hello!” “Wait, how are you—” Jared asked.“Changed my Saturday school to today. But I sneaked here, couldnt help but see you guys.” She winked at me. I seemed to be the only one happy to have someone besides Jared and I in the room. Jared seemed annoyed having someone stealing my attention, even if I wasnt talking.

Luckily, he was there when I arrived at the party. If he hadn’t been there i don’t know what would have happened. It was a party and i had gone because my friend had wanted me to. Even though i knew there was bond to be some sort of trouble. The party was in full swing when i arrived. Many of the people were long gone. It was easy to avoid the main crowd up until midnight. That was when i noticed that this one guy had been watching me for most of the night. I stepped away from my group to get some fresh air. The guy i had seen watching me was out there. He was drunk and wanted something that i would not give him. When i refused he stepped forward and got in between me and the door. I tried to push him aside but he grabbed my wrist.“No one ever tells me no.” His voice held venom and i felt myself cringe.“Hey, leave the girl alone.” I looked up. There was a boy not that much older then me. “She’s under my protection.” The guy let go of me and backed off apologizing all the time.“Thank you.” “Go home”
