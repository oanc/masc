My papa and my mama moved to the ranch fresh out of high school, two young love birds wanting to start a big family out on some nice land. Mama says now that she wished she had gone to college before getting married. Papa doesn’t regret it one bit, he loves the ranch.
My parents got their wish for a large family, only a year after they had moved farther out west Mama got pregnant. Nine months later, out popped Emma, fit as a fiddle and enough beauty to go around. Trust me, I’ve seen pictures of her as a baby, and even then she was gorgeous. I don’t want to talk about what she looks like now.
Almost right after Emma came Kayla, also healthy and strong, but the opposite of Emma in all ways. Dark hair, pale skin, charcoal eyes and tiny features. But, nevertheless, Kayla was also beautiful. Of course.
After Kayla Mama got pregnant with me. One more time. The doctor said that Mama wasn’t going to be able to have any more babies.
Papa prayed day and night for a boy.
And instead, he got plain old me.
Alice.

The tiny bit of hope was fading fast from Kyle’s face. Janice knew this must have been killing him.
“I… I…” she stammered on, killing him more with every I. His eyes pleaded with her. Words can’t even describe the vileness that was emanating from the voice in her heard.
“I… I… yes,” she finally forced out some how. It was Kyle’s turn not to believe his ears. “Yes, I would love to be your girlfriend.” Kyle’s face lightened up immediately. A huge smile spread across his face, mirroring the one on Janice’s. They stood there smiling at eachother.
Kyle laughed, “Um, I really don’t know what to say. I never really thought this far.” Janice laughed too,”You should think through your entire master plan the next time.” “Well I didn’t know what you would say and that was a major part of the plan, wouldn’t you agree?” “Yes, I would have to agree. I guess my response is kind of pivotal.” “I would say. If you had said no it would’ve really sucked and I’d probably be moping around somewhere.”

At long last it was Thanksgiving. Finally the day to sit around and stuff so much food down your throat you think you’re going to explode. Eat food, eat some more food, even more food, and then football. Thanksgiving had to be one of the greatest days of the year. Little did Addy know it wouldn’t go quite as expected.
Addy walked into her aunt’s house and said hi to all of the random old people that had gathered to tell her how big she had gotten and how they used to change her diaper and how they all remember when she was little, a classic Thanksgiving tradition. One Addy wasn’t to fond of. She just wanted to get to the food. All week she had fasted in preparation for this one meal.
Finally they were all gathered around the long table, her uncle saying grace. “Blah blah thanks blah blah god blah blah turkey blah blah” was all she heard as she stared longingly at the feast before her. It was all she heard until the crash.

“What is-”
I put my finger to my lips. He would ruin everything. I want to bring him in, show him my world, and then poof he has to talk. I tapped my head.
I flitted over the hill, and looked back. He was standing stock-still. I motioned with my hand. He just smiled. He shook his head. Look. His voice resounded in my head. He pointed. I turned my head, searching…
Oh. Yes. That’s nothing of importance. He had seen the sign? Well then, he’ll just have to get past it. He had to come. I didn’t have any last resorts. I sighed deeply. He heard.
Oh, no, I think it’s something. His thoughts cut deep into me, and he started to walk towards the indent in the bark of the tree. How dare he.
I flew right in front of his face, shaking my head in a firm no. I grabbed his arm, but found my arms melted right through him. He didn’t notice. He kept walking past me. I hurried to catch up with him.
All I could hope for was that he didn’t know the signs…
“What the-”

Everyone turned. They all stared as the dust settled. Slowly, from what seemed to be a large, silvery walnut, emerged a small orange man with funny green hair. Addy’s mom was the only who found the ability to speak,”That.. that looks like an..”
“An oompa-loompa? Yes it is,” a tall, strange man said from behind everyone. He was dressed in a dark suite with a top hat. Everyone turned to the stranger. It was dad’s turn to talk, “What’s going on here? Who are you and what do you want with us?” “Isn’t it obvious? I’m Willy Wonka my dear sir. And I would like to enjoy a nice Thanksgiving Day meal with you all,” he said with a smile, “I’ve brought some dessert.”
No one knew what to say. They all just sat there as the oompa-loompa unloaded what looked like the greatest cake in the world. Addy couldn’t take it any longer, she was starving. “Will you fix the whole in the wall?” “Why of course I will,” Willy promised. “Well then come on and sit. Lets eat.” With no objections, they all settled down to eat the meal.


Disabilities Writing Prompt

Nobody is perfect. You may have heard the saying, “No one can do everything, but everyone can do something.”
This also applies to disabilities.
I myself deal with anxiety issues. Sometimes I am thought of as a weirdo by people who don’t truly understand me. Well, maybe I am unique and different from others, but I am still worthwhile and dignified.
So I strongly believe that people should look at the big picture instead of just judging others by the things they can’t do.
Instead of despising differences, celebrate them!Don’t shun and scorn people just because of things they can’t control. Help them and accept them. For they have hidden strengths which often go unseen. It takes more than the naked eye alone to percieve them. An open mind and heart are even more essential to the essence of understanding.
Hence, I challenge you to write a ficlet about disabilities.
So go ahead. What are you waiting for?

Many people think of middle school as a time that brings out the worst in everyone. Well, I understand what they’re saying. I mean, yeah, it’s a tough age for kids. But do you know what?My middle school years were awesome, and they brought out the best in me. I discovered strengths and talents that I had known of previously, but they were unleashed in new and wonderful ways.7th grade was an especially awesome year. I learned spectacular lessons and had two amazing teachers who impacted my life in ways I never thought possible. I discovered what life could be. Sure, there were some rough times, but I made it through them. There was always someone to help along the way. Despite the trials and tribulations in middle school, we should be thankful for these years.
If we don’t let them knock us down, then they will build us up. With God’s love, anything is possible. With His guidence, we can weather any storm and even realize that it wasn’t a storm after all. Just a hidden rainbow.

“Jane!” I exclaim, running up to my best friend at her locker.
“Kayla!” She says, closing her locker and turning to face me. “Yes?”
“Nothin’” I shrug and we laugh.
“Oh guess what!” She says, linking her arm through mine as we start off for our third hour.
“Hmm?” I ask.
“I dumped Dan today.” She tells me, nonchalontly.
I laugh, “Good for you.”
“Fo sho.” She nods.
“Hey Sweetie.” A voice says as I feel an arm wrap around my shoulder. “Hey Jane.”
“Hey Jude.” Jane says smiling at him politely and nudging me with her arm.
“Hey Baby.” I smile, turning towards him and kissing him lightly on his lips. I turn back and glare at Jane, causing us both to laugh.
The three of us walk down the hall towards our classes, Jane and my arms linked and Jude’s arm around my shoulder. Kids gawk at us but we pay them no mind, the three of us perfectly content with our friendship.
We get to Jane and my class and I kiss Jude goodbye.
“See you after class.” He says and walks off to his class.

“What were you trying to do to me?” He was screaming at my face. I flinched as he ran. I didn’t go after him. I knew I didn’t have long. I knew I would soon be hurling back towards my home empty-handed. But that didn’t hurt as much as seeing him like that.
I stared sadly at him as he tore down the mountain top, anxious and frightened. He hurled through the trees, and soon I couldn’t see him anymore, but I could smell him. I could smell his fear. He would be even more scared when he realized he couldn’t find his way back. Only with me could he escape this place. I just couldn’t…
I sat down on the grassy hill, hiding my head under my arms. Silent tears fell down my pastel cheeks, which were now almost invisible. Soon I would be gone. I swallowed back my tears, choking on the bitter taste of resent and guilt.
I looked up at the tree. I glared, anger and agony pouring from my soul. I grabbed a stone. I ripped at the bark, tearing at the writing. Soon it was unreadable. Good. Now none of them had a chance.

Soon I felt the familiar tugs at my body. First my wings, which fluttered, as though they were their own person. I couldn’t stop it. I couldn’t stop anything.
I felt it at my back, and my legs buckled. Soon, I knew, the wind would come.
I looked deep inside me, searching for the hidden connection. Ah. There. I closed my eyes, letting them see him.
He ran without much purpose now. He was stumbling. He tripped, and pulled himself up again. He ran faster, but sluggishly. And then he tripped again. Only this time he didn’t get up.
I couldn’t watch. I opened my eyes, freeing myself. I couldn’t save him now. I had sat here too long. I never do anything right.
First I was appointed to counsel, and then I lost that position. Oh the humility! And now, the one chance to redeem myself… and I had done the one thing I was never supposed to do.
Fall in love.
I stood up suddenly, pulling away from the strong winds. As quick as I could, I scratched in the symbol in the tree once more.
Danger for man. Sprites.

Concern still etched into his countenance, Alex sat, defeated, back down on the sofa. Chloe was staring into the screen almost lifelessly. It was like the Chloe from the day of the court case was back. She was silent and hollow.
For a few minutes Alex face the television and faked polite interest in the movie. But he couldn’t honestly ignore his… companion’s suffering for very long. Very gently, I pushed himself closer to Chloe and wrapped an arm around her shoulders. His other arm reached for an afghan on the back of the couch. He shook the blanket and tossed it over her folded legs.
She made no move to shrug him off and said nothing in response to his own wordless gesture. Alex thought about what he needed to say to bring her back.
He began, “Hi there, Chloe.”
Alex waited.
“I know you’re in there somewhere,” he coaxed.
“I want you to know that my idea of happiness is just being with you for as long as you’ll let me.”
Chloe’s eyes closed, damming up the tears.
“Chloe, I love you.”

I wrapped my arms around my sides, rocking back and forth while in tears, “Stop please,” I rasped, “Stop doing this.”
“Stop? You want me to stop?” Cody went and shot my childhood crush, Mitchell, the red-head falling to the ground way too close to me. He looked at me, staring me straight in the eyes, only to smile and laugh. I watched the life go away from Mitchell’s eyes as the shrieking proceeded, making me scream along with it. But instead of a final thought, I got an entire scene from Mitchell’s life:
I sat across the lunchtable from Bree, taking in secret glances at her and her slightly wavy gold hair. What could I say? I liked her….though this was 3rd grade. I continued looking at my food until I heard Bree say, “Hey Mitch!” I shot my face up to look at her and her blue eyes…only to have her straw paper fly into my mouth. I made a funny surprised face which made Bree giggle. The other guys at the table laughed along with her. I swore then and there that I would tell her my feelings…soon.

I hurried off to the lunchroom, pushing James’ angry face deeper into the fragments of my memory. I saw John’s figure leaning against the wall, and my heart beat faster. My face flushed, and my palms grew sweaty. I sighed, and smiled. His face lit up as soon as he saw me.“Hey shortie,” he said lauging. I scowled; he was a good six inches taller than me, there was no need to make it obvious. He laughed again, and then leaned down to hug me. “Are you ready?” I nodded. He pulled me closer to him, holding my hand. He led me to the student parking lot around back. “You going to tell me where you’re taking me?” I tried. He laughed again and just shook his head. I frowned and settled back in my seat. I closed my eyes. “Wake me when we get there, alright?” “Sure sure,” he mumbled. I heard him shift in his seat, and then felt his warm lips as they pressed against mine. He kissed me for a few minutes, before finally pulling away. I kept my eyes open now, staring at him. He held my hand as he drove, smiling.

The two met outside the Shreiking Shack. It had provided useful over the years. But the shack was just the tip of the iceberg.
“I hope you’re ready to demontsrate what you can do to Lord Xavin,” she remarked to Gunther. He grunted in reply and swung his gun in a more comfortable position.
The two entered through a slanted door. Gunther looked around. “This is it?” he questioned. Facaro turned to him “Patience you stupid midget,” she said irritably.
They stepped into the next room where a sort of elevator stood. Gunther cautiously stepped onto the rickety device. Facaro swept her wand and they quickly plumeted at least 50 feet.
The doors opened with a soft beep and Facaro stepped out. Gunther followed in an exasperated waddle. He stopped nearly bumping into Facaro. “hey, what’s the big-” he began, but looked around her and he to stared in amazement.

“So when’s she coming down?” my father asked, but not looking at me this time. For a moment I considered pretending that I couldn’t hear him because of my music, but refrained.“Today, actually. She’s getting set up at her aunt’s house and I’ll be able to see her tomorrow.” and I added in my head: if you let me…
He nodded and continued looking at the road. I turned my music up slightly to take my mind away from the place I was in. And for a moment, being in the car with my father seemed unbearable. For split second, I felt a wave of uncontrollable anger come over me. I didn’t want to be there. I didn’t want him to control whether I got to see Rose or not.
He doesn’t know what I’ve gone through…, I thought to myself, knowing it was 100% true. But another thought interupted this one, mm but if he knew, he’d probly send me to a psychiatrist.
I shook my head to clear my mind. I didn’t need to be thinking of these things. Soon I would be with Rose, and that made me smile.
