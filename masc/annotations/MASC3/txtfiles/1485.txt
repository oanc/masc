"Anyways,"? I continued, "I like it here, all in all. It's a nice place, and normally no one bothers me. I've made a few casual acquaintances here, but that's all, really. Some girls said some pretty harsh things to me in the beginning, but then nothing of the sort happened again. So I'm grateful to be here, I suppose. It's fun."?Casimir raised an eyebrow. "What did they say?"? he asked curiously. "If you don't mind me asking, that is."?"Well,"? I said, taking a deep breath, "long story short, they called me a weirdo and an alien. I told them how I was found and that I was adopted, which I probably shouldn't have. But it doesn't matter now."?"They might be impressed by the fact that you brought a boy to camp with you,"? Casimir remarked lightheartedly. I giggled in spite of myself.

“Promise me?” She said.
“Forever and always babe, I’ll never leave you, always love you, never let you shed a tear, never make you wipe off that smile” He said.
“Really?” She asked in disbelief.
“Yes, and I have to ask you something..”He said slowly.
“Yes, of course, anything” She said, her eyes flickering with confusion.
Her hazel eyes bright with excitement, her auburn hair slightly convering her face.
As he kneeled down, she gasped and put her hand over her face, hiding her fervent smile underneathe. Her cheeks filled with color. He revealed a small compacted box cloaked with a royal blue felt.
She felt her heart beat quicken, it felt like it was about to burst with anticipation, full of love for him, so much for her to give.
“Luna…will you marry me?” He asked her, his lungs constricted for her approval. He continued on”Will you be mine?”
Her lips finally opened and said “Forever and always”
His whole aura seemed to brighten as he placed the ring on her finger.

From there, we spoke some more, until the clock struck 9:00. About a dozen girls filed into the classroom, all taking a moment or so to look upon the male stranger who was present at an all-girls camp. No one spoke directly to either of us, but there were some curious glances and whispers among the campers. From what I could fathom, they weren't mean or threatening murmurs, but just inquiries. I can imagine they were thinking, "Who is that chap sitting next to the Hoosier girl?"? "Is he her brother or some other relative? Or maybe they're a pair."? " "˜Tis a curiosity for sure. Perhaps he mistakenly wandered here from a boys' camp in the area? I wonder who he is."?The instructor, Mrs. Creagan, had been notified of Casimir's visit. When she came to the front of the room, she said, "Ladies, we have a very special visitor today. His name is Casimir Chrysanthemum. Can you all give him a warm welcome?"? she said. "Good morning, Casimir,"? a chorus of female voices answered systematically.

Mrs. Creagan continued, "He is the son of Mr. Arthur Chrysanthemum. Their family gives generously to this camp each year."? Casimir said to me in a low whisper, "Family? Ha! Hardly."? I knew he'd get over it sooner or later. "His mentor for the day is Essie Miracle. Casimir, if you have any questions, then feel free to ask any of the girls. I hope you enjoy your visit here at the Leaps and Bounds. Now, would you like to tell us all a little about yourself?"? the teacher asked. After a moment, Casimir firmly stood up, the chair hitting the table as he pushed it in. Using a dignified voice, he said to the class, "My name is Casimir, and I'm glad I got the chance to be present at this camp. Essie told me about it, and she deemed that it would be a fine idea if I came. So, it's nice to meet you all, and I bid you salutations."? Then, he sat back down. He was quiet with his gaze fixed on nothing in particular, but a thoughtful expression was displayed on his face.

At camp that day, we were doing a project called "self definition and symbolization"? watercolor paintings. We weren't meant to pay fine attention to detail, and we could use other forms of mixed media to enhance the effect of our paintings. All in all, it was meant to be a sort of abstract piece of art. When I heard the mention of symbolization, I remembered the time all of those years ago when I had a similar assignment for school. It was to write a poem, and I chose a rainbow. A rainbow. It had been a while since I had seen one. Now, I knew what I would draw. I recalled the poster I had created several months ago, and I realized how much it summed up. Of course, it had a rainbow on it, with many people standing underneath. Two of those people were meant to symbolize my father and me, but then my mind reeled to a surprising reminiscence. There was also a boy standing beside me. My recollection was accurate – I had spent the longest time drawing him.

Slender, delicate figure, yet somehow imposing at the same time; hair that was sort of a light brown with natural dark highlights. Unforgettable eyes. At the time, I had not known who that boy was. But now my mind could trace it. Casimir.
I interpreted this realization the way Casimir perceived seeing me for the first time, a piece of his mother. If I could explain it, I could say that it was like I knew someone before I actually heard of their existence; and before meeting them. ‘Twas as if I had always dreamed of something…something that I could never put my finger on or remember in the morning. Yet a piece of whatever it was clung to me and didn’t let go. I’d call it a residing dream. Could it have been a rainbow glittering in the moonlight, if such a thing was possible? Or the long hallways, a blue striped handkerchief, a letter, a white rabbit, or…a face with eyes that I could dwell forever in…?

I glanced at Casimir, who had begun his painting. It consisted of a blue raindrop, which was a tear. Many smaller ones were in the vicinity of it. There was a lighting bolt and a gray storm cloud, but also a white cotton cloud in a heavenly blue sky. Peeking out from it was a bit of sunshine. There was red, though it gave me the impression of determination and passion rather than pain and suffering. Nearby was a heart, which was a deep red. When I looked closer, I noticed that there was a faint line going through the middle of the heart. It symbolized what had been broken at one time, but had been put back together in one piece. There was a bandage and a friendly hand, as well as a rabbit with sapphire eyes. In addition to this were flowers, a paper clip, and a light. It was shining as a star, in the midst of dark colored paint. To the left, there was a pair of wings and a halo that belonged to an angel.

“My motha tol’me neva’t’talk’t strangers, buddy,” this Alex said in a low, threatening, Manhattan-gritted voice. “And I can tell that you two are stranger than most.”
He shook my companion by the collar. “Y’see this here?” he asked quietly, pulling out a pistol. Mike nodded helplessly. “If I wanted to, I could jus’put this right here,” he stuck the barrel just below Mike’s quivering jaw, “then  BANG !” We both jumped. Alex chuckled to himself.
“But I ain’t gunna do that. Not yet. Now you two listen carefully. I’m gonna let you go, & I’m gonna give you a minute to scram. I’ll give yehs a thirty-second warning shot, but my next shot at sixty’s gonna be on target. Y’unnastan’?”

For some inexplicable reason, I had overlooked what was in the middle of it all. It was a vague painting of a face whose countenance could not be seen. But I knew it was that of a girl, however devoid of detail the painting was. A rainbow flew onto my paper, and so did sunshine, its rays outstretching. I tried to portray my dreams, which led to abstract results. I painted all of the letters I had received and written, and all of the sunsets I had seen. I vaguely depicted a boy and a girl holding hands. A heart locket was present, as was a baby wrapped in a blanket. I painted open fields of flowers and a dove flying freely. I painted all that I had ever loved and cherished, and all that I would never forget.

When I had finished, I exhaled deeply and sat back to admire my work. "Wow, Essie,"? Casimir said. "It's like you portrayed heaven through your own eyes."? "What do you mean?"? I asked him. "What I'm trying to say is, you appeared to have taken every piece of goodness, love, and truth and incorporated it into the painting. I reckon it's a whimsical masterpiece,"? Casimir replied. A couple minutes later, during social hour, many of the girls had several comments and questions for Casimir. They were things such as, "Wow! I never heard of you before. But there's a plaque in the meeting all that gives your father recognition as a big sponsor for this camp. Have you ever been here before?"? "I was here two years ago when he accepted an award,"? Casimir replied dryly. "Where do you live? Are you from around here?"?"I live about three minutes away from this camp."?"Why does your father sponsor this camp? What made him decide to?"?"My mother went here,"? he said quietly. I knew this was a sensitive subject for him.

"What does she do now? How is she like?"?Casimir was silent. He looked away from everyone. Then, in an almost inaudible whisper, he replied, "She passed away when I was little. About eight years ago."?For a moment, no one said anything.
Then, Casimir said, "There's a picture of her in the meeting hall. It says, "˜In memory of Carlena Leigh Chrysanthemum. 1951-1981. May her soul live on here and everywhere, forever and always.' "?
This sent a chill running down my spine, and I couldn't believe it. Self-consciously, I opened up my heart locket. I looked at the words engraved on the inside for the longest time. I had a flashback of when Casimir and I had seen a picture of Mona Lisa at the museum, and we were amazed at how something like that could live on for centuries. For a moment, I felt as if I was breathing in the essence of forever, and I felt the dÃ©jÃ  vu and connections all around me. My soul felt as though it had been touched by an angel and kissed by a dream.

I don't know what to do.
I never know what to do. That line is overused in my life. So, so overused. I'm supposed to be the mature one. The grown up, intelligent daughter whom no one notices. I'm too quiet, that's why they don't notice me. I'm too quiet, and too grown up. I grew up in fifth grade, when I tried so hard to impress people that being mature took over my life.
I want to go back to days spent with friends and laughing at jokes that didn't end in someone saying "that's what she said."? I miss the days when I actually had fun with my best friends. I miss when I told my parents everything and when they didn't drink too much. I miss when my friends cared about me. I miss when I didn't talk to boys and I miss when I wasn't so self conscious.
I wish I could go back in time and never have to deal with any of this. I wish I could I hug my Mom and not feel guilty about being around.wish I could have better friends. I wish I could change everything. I wish I had someone to love me back.
Somebody miss me?

I decided to have a chat with Liam after dinner. “Liam,” I asked, knocking on his door, “Can I talk to you?” Liam gladly opened his door for me, taking a seat back on his bed. I joined him and broke the ice by asking, “Do you like me Liam?”
“Of course! You’re like a part of my life. I’ve known you for like…ever.” He exclaimed.
“What would you think of me being your dad?”
“Oh that would be so sweet! I mean, though you already are like a father to me, to make it official would be…wow.” Liam grinned from ear to ear with excitement.
“Alright, so I guess I have your blessings in proposing to your mom.”
“Of course.”
“So now about that girl of yours…” I began and Liam immediatly blushed at the word “girl”. “She’s just my friend,” He weakly fought back. I laughed, “Alright whatever you say. Just don’t do anything bad with each other…”

"Casimir,"? I said to him, "do you think you could show it to me later?"? I asked him. "Yes. Perhaps during lunch,"? he replied.
"So, how do you know Essie?"? One of the girls asked. I thought I heard a small twinge of jealousy in her voice."Oh, she's staying at my house for the summer. She lives all the way back in America. I met her in the beginning of July,"? Casimir told her. I had to admit that I wasn't thrilled with the fact that a bunch of other girls were talking to Casimir. He always made me feel special, and he had made it clear that I was his sunshine. I didn't want that to change. As much as I wished for Casimir to grow as a person and in happiness, and as glad as I was that he was coming out of his shell of sadness, I never wanted him to be captivated by any other adolescence but myself. After all, wasn't I the only one for him? Then again, I didn't own him. If anything, I wanted him to see the world more.

If I truly loved him, then I would let him expand his horizons. In essence, this was what was meant to be all along.
Nevertheless, Casimir did not seem very captivated or intrigued by the girls at camp. He was enjoying himself and having a wonderful time, but I believe this was because he felt the presence of his mother. And because he was with me.
Later, after asking permission of one of the counselors, Casimir took me to the meeting hall and showed me his mother’s picture. She was smiling brightly, her eyes dancing with liveliness. I noticed that her hair was black with light brownish highlights, while Casimir’s was light brownish with black highlights.
One couldn’t tell their resemblance at a brief glance, but if one looked thoroughly, then they could perceive it.

Could Leslie really know this person?Then again, I thought, think about who she grew up with. It seems less outrageous that way.

"Just looking at her makes my heart tremble all over again. But now, I feel more of the love than the pain of loss. And I feel much better,"? Casimir told me. Somehow, I felt lighter. I recalled that day in the library when Casimir had said such dark things and indulged in pain. Now, he reminded me of a bear who had come out of hibernation, or a plant that had survived winter's frost. The sunshine that poured through the room was proof enough that Casimir's previous outlooks and perspectives of the world had changed. Hope was profound, and meaningful too.
After that, Casimir would attend camp with me. It was strange, what with him being the only boy, but he was allowed to go with me for the time being. He wasn't an official camper, and we would only be going to camp for a few more days. Since he was Mr. Chrysanthemum's son, he was allowed to visit for the time being. I was glad to have a friend at camp with me, and Casimir was happy to have something to do during the day.

“Shh, here they come.” Patrick crouched behind some rundown chairs and hastily retied Sarah’s gag.“So!” Carter cried out enthusiastically. “Have you thought about if you’ll tell me or not?” She stayed silent. “Bitter, are we?” He nudged Dylan with a sneer. “Well, we can’t have that!” He nodded, and Dylan carefully took off the gag. “It’ll be more interesting if I can hear your lovely voice.” “I’ll ask you one more time: do you or do you not wish to tell me what I want to know?” “And what is it that you want to know?” His eyes narrowed dangerously. “You know what I want to know.” “Can’t say I do.” Carter slipped a Zippo lighter out of his pocket. He flicked it open, bringing it closer and closer to Sarah’s arm with his finger frighteningly close to the ignitor.“You know perfectly well. But if you insist on being stubborn I must resort to desperate mesures…” “No you’re not!” Patrick cried. Carter looked up, mildly surprised. “Well, if isn’t the knight in shining armor,” he drawled.
