I felt bad the entire day, although thankfully, I didnt show it. "That was still pretty good what you did to Shannen. She is so annoying. I cant believe I was her friend,"? Jared laughed while we were walking home. "What happened?"? I asked curiously. He was hesitant to answer the question."Just"¦ personal reasons,"? "Okay,"? I wasnt going to force anything out of him just yet.
"Jared called to see you came home alright, sweetie,"? mother shouted. I sighed, not making any comments. My parents couldnt know I didnt like him. I finished my homework, quickly that night. I decided to call Jueli."Hey Gabe!"? she said excitingly, "Sorry for missing school today, what happened?"? "I had to dis Shannen because of this stupid plan. But I did find out that he has something against her,"? I explained."What do you mean?"? "Well he obvously did something to her, which he wants to keep a sercret."? "Well, there's only one thing to do"¦ three way. Call Jared and asked what happened."?
I shuttered at the thought

She was as good as his—she just didn’t know it yet. All he needed to do now was be patient, bide his time…
Unfortunately, patience wasn’t one of Milton’s better virtues. And it was hard to be patient when you were crammed into a small walk-in closet with no light and little air. He squirmed, trying to find a better position, but the closet was crammed full of clothes, wispy blouses that stuck to his mouth and scratchy jeans that grazed his cheek. Milton extricated a scarf from around his arm and froze, suddenly hearing the unmistakable sound of a key turning in the lock. Heels could then be heard clicking across the living room and down the hall.
“Hi, honey, I’m ho-ome!” she sang, her pure voice ringing out like a bell. Milton’s hands were beginning to sweat now.
“Come on, man, get a hold of yourself,” he berated himself, wiping his hands on his pants.
The heels click-clacked into the bedroom. Milton could see her silhouette through the chinks in the closet door, could almost smell her perfume.

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“You do.”
“No I-”
Anne raised a finger, stopping me in my tracks. She started writing again, scratching away. She was muttering to herself.
“The young girl was faced with the choice… but now in denial she…”
She broke off, fingering the paper.
”...decided to stay alone, still, as always, in darkness.”
“I am not in denial!”
She continued writing, and I crossed my arms and stared at her defiantly.
“Are we just gonna sit here, or are you going to tell me what’s going on?”
“I’ll tell you, of course.” Anne dotted her pen forcefully to make a tiny period, and then put it down. Turning to face me, she folded her small hands in her lap.
“Everett is… well he… He was hoping you would come.”
Whaa?
“He, well, he’s lying to himself, I can tell. We can all tell, I know it.”
“Who’s we?”
“You, Alice, and myself.”
“An eleven year olds vote doesn’t count much.”
“You’d be surprised.”
Oh, I’m not so sure. Nothing can surprise me now.

I lay in the tall grass, the sun radiating from its place in the sky. It’s heat reached my already scorching body.
I had snuck away, not because I had felt the need to be disobedient, but because I had felt the need to be alone. The last couple of days had been difficult. Painful, and difficult.
Papa thought I was sick the moment I walked into the room three days ago. My throat was sore, and I could barely swallow my porridge. In fact, I through it right up after I ate. I had a fever.
That’s when Mama had put me to bed, and called the doctor.
The doctor said I was to stay in bed until I was feeling well again.
I had diphtheria. I was not going to last long.
He didn’t want me to know, but I heard him talking to Papa.
I buried my head in the sweet smelling grass, crying silently. I looked up, taking in everything around me. The big white clouds, over the bright sun. The wheat grass whistling in the wind, their own little melody. It was all so beautiful.
I was going to miss this place.

And so we auditioned for America’s Next Big Top Reality show, the gorilla, the penguin eating Fruit Loops and a bunch of sad clowns with no make -up. Of course I could have wondered into Congress by mistake.
A Ryan Seacrest lookalike was the host. The penguins were up first and ate a bowl of Fruit Loops. They were voted off the show before it began by a sober Paula Abdul.. I know this is where my story loses all credibility, but trust me I was there it really happened..
Anyway I digress.. the gorilla auditioned next and all the celebrity Big Top judges andvaced the Gorilla to the finals. Perhaps the look the gorilla threw their way swayed them.. but that could be me being jealous of the talented gorilla.
My turn finally came and I auditioned with gusto. Gusto was my pint sized dwarfish side kick ..in drag. Gusto works cheap so beggars can’t be choosers. Anyway I juggled penguins.. hey they needed jobs.
I was booed.. is that even a word?
Well their loss .. so it was off to Wash D.C to witness history.

“Ok, so here is the costume for the first scene, “Ohmigod you guys!” Gertie handed me two dresses. “Your supposed to put the pink dress under the white dress, because Elle is supposed to be trying on clothes, and she changes out of the white dress into the pink dress. Your going to have to do a quick change.” “Oh thats easy! How many seconds do I have to change?” “Hmmmm.” Gertie thought.“About 10 seconds.” “10  SECONDS !” “Don’t worry, the Delta Nu Girls will surrond you, and you will pull off the white dress, because it will be magnet clipped together.” “Gertie, is it ok to be confused?” She smiled.“Of course!

“Are you sure you’re not cold?” I huddled beside him, my breath coming out in puffs of steam.“I’m f-f-fine,” I replied and leaned into him. I was out in the forest, yet again. My mother was getting quite annoyed with my sleepiness, along with my friends. But I couldn’t help it, my heart wouldn’t let me not see Ryan at every chance I could.“We could build a fire tonight if you wanted” He spoke and wrapped his arm around my waist. I took his earthy scent in with a deep sigh. A thought suddenly came to mind. I turned to stare into his dark eyes.“Can’t you just come to my house? My mother won’t mind.” He frowned and looked away.“You know I can’t Fay. I don’t exist, you aren’t even supposed to know I’m here.” “But why not? You could go to school, you could get a job and have a home to live in!” I persisted. He shook his head.“It’s more complicated then that. I can’t stay in one place for too long of a time. That’s just the way I am” I suddenly felt a pull on my heart.“You won’t leave will you?”

I saw the old man, his hair wild, crouched over a piano. I was unsure whether to approach the great man, but the music had latched onto me, beckoned me towards him.
It wasn’t before long until I was standing in “the spot;” the perfect spot about a yard from the first curve of the grand. Here, I was drowning in the sound & the power this great man drew from the instrument. It was commanding, but it wasn’t banging.
I couldn’t believe that I was the presence of one of the greatest, if not thee greatest, composer who ever lived.
Even if it was only in my dreams.
He finished the movement of one of his sonatas, hovered his hands over the keys for an eternal second, then turned to look at me.
Man, this guy has an intimidating stare.
I cleared my throat. “Maestro Beetoven, I just wanted to wish you a happy birthday!”
He furrowed his brow, confused.
“Happy birthday, Maestro!” I said, a bit louder.
He cupped his hand around his ear.
“ VHAT ?” he bellowed.
Happy 238th, Ludwig

“Don’t slouch! You’re pounding on the keys again! Stop making such odd facial exspressions!” The ring of the piano echoed around the large, dark ballroom. Sleepiness clung to my eyelids, I tried desperately to keep up with the tempo my mother had set. She wore a face of pure annoyance.“Stop stop stop!” I heaved in a deep breath and stilled my hands.”Evelyn, I thought you knew this song!” “I do mother but-” “Then please play it! That was utterly horrid!” “I am trying mother. We’ve been at this all morning! May I please take a moment to breathe?!” The last sentence seemed like it wasn’t just about the morning practice. I stood and turned to Karmedy.“Please get me a cup of tea” The maid nodded and hurried away. I didn’t meet my mothers gaze as I stepped away from her toward the curtained windows. Suddenly with a growl I grasped the cloth in my fingers and ripped it away, bright sunshine streamed in. I stood blinded for a second. When my vision cleared I noticed a carriage parked in front of my house.

Okay, so I decided to enter this challenge, and do something that I’ve never done before. I’ve included a journal entry from my diary. The names of people, places, etc. have all been changed. Happy reading.
August 14, 2008
I could’ve never imagined how I could suffer so many devastating blows in one day. Now life isn’t the same. It won’t be that way ever again. It’s brutally sad and scary beyond words how things can come crashing down so quickly. Life is prompted to be percieved as an exponentially trecherous scheme to aggravate and destroy it’s contestants. You have no idea…you’ll never know…even if I told you, you still wouldn’t understand. You wouldn’t care. My perception of life and outlook on the world has been damned for all that was overlooked. A sword has struck my heart; a false message in a bottle has crashed to the floor and landed in a thousand broken pieces.

It contained all of my giddy, stupid hopes that were no more than rainbows – exactly so! Rainbows. Views that were so clearly unrealistic and foolish to ever believe. It doesn’t even matter anymore though. Alas, now I mourn at the shattered rainbows.
It started out a normal fine day, and now I see it as sheer horrid irony. I had an appointment to talk to my theripist. There have been numerous things on my mind this summer, so there was so much that I needed to say. And so I spoke of my paranoia that things wouldn’t be the same with my friends, along with all of my other worries. Then, she told me something. My theripist said that she would be leaving to go take care of her father. She told me it was similar to when my mom was busy taking care of my grandpa. She wasn’t around as much. At first, I didn’t fully understand. She said that I could still email her, and maybe once in a while she could come back and we could talk.

I had been coming to talk to her ever since I was seven, and I found a sense of security and stability through seeing a theripist. Talking to someone besides Mom was a secondary referance that I could always fall back on. I bet you’re laughing now. Hey, look at me, I’m the crazy little girl who just lost her shrink! I never told any of my friends that I go to see a theripist, since they just wouldn’t understand. I didn’t need another reason for people to think I was strange; at least not in an insane way. But the truth is, I don’t think it’s someone’s fault if they have to see a psycologist. How is it? It’s not like I asked to have  OCD  and anxiety issues and everything. I just am…me. Suffice to say, I knew I couldn’t talk to anyone besides my mom about losing my theripist. If anything, I need people to think that I have it all together. After all, I think I do; more than some of my friends do, anyways.

Yet at the same time, I yearn for the whole world to feel bad for me. I deserve it, because of… everything…
I found it hard to swallow that my theripist would be quitting her practice; I didn’t know how to react. I told myself that I would get through it and this problem could be fixed. Luckily, she told my mom about another phycologist who words in the same building. Before I left, she handed me a small package wrapped in blue paper. She told me that I had come a long way, and that she was so proud of me. I knew that life was changing, but I kept my faith in hope. I believed that I could hold on somehow.
When I opened up the package, it revealed to be a little book titled, “Believe & Achieve: Inspiration for the Journey Called Life.” On the inside, my theripist had written a message. It said, “I will miss you very much. You are a strong person with countless gifts to offer the world and everyone you meet.”

As mom and I left the office today, I felt bittersweet emotions. On one hand, I felt accomplished and wise. My heart was warmed by the book, and even more by the thought behind it. At the same time, I felt like a part of my support system was gone, and vulnerable by the fact that I needed one to begin with. But I felt okay by and large, because…because I didn’t know. That’s why.
When I came home, I was thrilled to find out that I had recieved a letter in the mail from my friend Julie. We had just gotten to know each other this year, but we had so many things in common. If only we weren’t both so shy. Getting the letter was the best part of the day, but perhaps also the worst. Correction. Definately the worst. Her letter was very sweet and filled with kind words. Julie’s handwriting was meticulously neat. My heart was warmed by her kind words, up to the part where she wrote,Love from your friend who sincerly closes this letter with best wishes, Julie. If only the letter had ended there.

If that was the ultimate closing of the letter, then I wouldn’t have burst out into tears. But the last two sentences were the most defining part of the whole message, as well as the part that broke my heart. It read:P.S. – I don’t know how to say this, but I don’t think I’m coming back to St. Anges next year. I want to stay in touch and do things together, no matter where I go to school.
For a moment, I stopped breathing. Tears trickled down my face nonstop. The last time I had been so shocked was when I found out that my grandpa died. I realized once and for all with monrose and penetrating sorrow just how cruel life can be. I lost January, just as I had lost two of my other friends who had gone to St. Agnes. Except, this time, Julie had the ultimate say. She chose to leave the school she went to forever. She had been accepted into a lottery school called Oscar’s that was meant to be more academically challenging. How could she do something so inexplicable haunting?

Nothing makes sense anymore. Well, maybe life stopped making sense a long time ago. I don’t know what I imagined. That we would develop a strong friendship in 8th grade and be BFFs forever? I’m not a fool, and I can’t say that I imagined that. But I thought if Julie came back, then things would be…I don’t know, more promising? Even with the paranoia of all of my friends suddenly abandoning me, I knew that Julie would always support me and never shun. After all, she did that for one of our other friends, who was a big gossiper. So I knew that Julie would definatly be friends with a weird girl like me, despite what anyone else thought. What was to become of my school days?

I remember how I couldn’t stop crying, and Mom knew why. After all, she had heard all about how Julie was considering going to Oscar’s, and she understood why it would be able to offer so much to Julie. Mom told me that now our friendship could blossem freely. True, we didn’t talk very much at school, but still. It’s not like anyone else would’ve objected to our friendship. And if so, then to hell with them! None of my friends would’ve understood how much losting Julie could hurt me, just like how they couldn’t understand me seeing a theripist. When I really think about it, I know that I am not overestimating Julie or underestimating my ability and capability to stand on my own.
Friends forever…friends forever…friends forever… a part of me whispered. Why did fate have to be so bloody cruel? After all, I had already lost my grandfather, who meant more to me than all of my friends put together. It was only a matter of time before I lost someone else whom I also held dear.

“She was the one who taught me what forever meant!” I shouted. Whenever I heard someone say, “Life’s not fair,” I never believed that I would someday have to take so many blows as to acquire that knoweledge so sharply and thoroughly. Well, it didn’t end there. Of course, another letter came in the mail today. It regarded academics, but in a different way than Julie’s letter had. It was from my school, St. Agnes, and it informed me that it would be best if I stayed in the regular math program for 8th grade, instead of taking advanced math. I wonder if my friends decided to take advanced math. Did my math teacher even know that I wanted to be in Math A? I had learned so much this year, and it would be such an honor if I could… it doesn’t matter. I tried to put it out of my mind, for I knew that I couldn’t deal with it today. Not after everything else that I had gone through.
