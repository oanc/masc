<TURN>
all right Amy /
how are you doing today [*T*-1] /
<TURN>
fine fine /
<TURN>
oh all righty /
i think [0] we know what we 're going [*-1] to speak about [*T*-2] /
um [*PRO*] tell you what /
i 'll start off /
how 's that [*T*-1] /
<TURN>
yeah /
okay you go ahead /
<LU_ANNOTATE>
<TURN>
um i personally think [*PRO*] to set a mark with the judicial system and we 're talking about criminals criminal cases that they should bring back -- <TURN> um-hum / <TURN> -- hangings on weekends -- <TURN> in public places / <TURN> -- in public places /
there is one state that [*T*-1] does that by the way /
<TURN>
yeah /
really /
what is that [*T*-1] /
<TURN>
i want [*PRO*-1] to say Oklahoma /
i saw report something [*ICH*-1] the other night about it /
<TURN>
hm
<TURN>
they do n't do them real often which [*T*-1] is obviously the death penalty /
<TURN>
yeah /
yeah /
<TURN>
um but i think [0] if we quit uh [*-1] building these Taj Mahals with the color TVs and <disfluency> sixty dollars </disfluency> sixty thousand a year [0] [*T*-2] to keep an inmate in there <disfluency> on a on a </disfluency> on a life sentence we should start [*-3] hanging them and get it over with /
and [*PRO*] let 's just screwing up the system uh /
<TURN>
yeah /
well the sentences are so unbelievable /
i just saw on the news last night that they said [0] the average time [0] a sentenced murderer you know is in jail [*T*-1] is two years before he 's paroled [*-2] and a rapists is like six months and a burglar is like two months /
<TURN>
that 's pathetic /
that 's pathetic /
it 's /-
<TURN>
because they just say [0] there 's either no room in the system you know in the jails for them /
or you know it 's just that it seems like the automatic sentences <disfluency> if </disfluency> if a judge has leeway on what he 's going [*-1] to you know sentence someone for [*T*-2] between you know two months and uh fifty years and you know what [*T*-3] 's his whim [*PRO*] to decide [0] it should be two months /
<TURN>
this is true /
<disfluency> and and and and </disfluency> and the way [0] the law reads [*T*-1] uh if they sentence you to -- <TURN> you know it 's crazy / <TURN> -- life in prison then he 's available for parole <disfluency> if it 's </disfluency> if it 's life and a day then he 's not eligible for parole /
so what /
you know [*PRO*] let 's quit [*-1] BSing with the system /
<TURN>
yeah /
well even if it 's life like you say [*?*] we end up [*-1] spending sixty thousand dollars a year [*PRO*] to keep some you know joker in there for life /
we could spend that money you know for starving children that [*T*-1] are starving or twelve million other things would be more useful than that /
<TURN>
exactly /
<TURN>
so to me if somebody has life you know beyond a reasonable doubt <disfluency> they should </disfluency> that should be it you know particularly for some of these really /-
<TURN>
a life for a life /
<TURN>
i mean there are so many just major major serial murders /
and it 's not just like one instance or something /
it [*EXP*-2] 's just uh horrifying some of the murders that [*T*-1] go on /
<TURN>
the old Charles Manson case /
i mean the guy <disfluency> is really </disfluency> -- <TURN> yeah / and the /- yeah / there 's just /- everyday you hear on the news of another one like that um /- <TURN> -- just should n't be allowed [*-1] <disfluency> to </disfluency> to <disfluency> even </disfluency> even live /
uh about the issue about sentencing by the judge -- <TURN> yeah / um-hum / <TURN> -- <disfluency> the </disfluency> the judge presently has an opportunity [*PRO*] to intervene uh <disfluency> when there 's </disfluency> uh my understanding when there 's uh a verdict [*T*-1] and it /-
for example there 's a hung jury here in Fort Worth /
two day in eight to four /
and bam bam the guy got off /
uh <disfluency> he was </disfluency> uh <disfluency> he </disfluency> he was a veterinarian and killed two a father and a son /
okay /
<TURN>
right /
yeah i heard about that on the news /
yeah /
<TURN>
um [*PRO*] kind of gets back to the second request [0] we 've been asked [*-1] [*PRO*-2] to look at [*T*-3] /
is most criminal cases requiring an ananimous verdict /
<disfluency> the </disfluency> a situation like that i 'd say no [*PRO*] let 's just go like a regular vote /
eight to four tells me that <disfluency> there were eight </disfluency> there 's a <disfluency> percentage </disfluency> certain percentage of the people there with <disfluency> sixty percent of the people </disfluency> uh seventy percent of the people said hey /-
<TURN>
right /
rather than [*PRO*] have [*-1] to retrial the <disfluency> whole </disfluency> whole thing and spend all the money for people [*ICH*-2] to you know go back to court and all the lawyers /
and i mean it [*EXP*-3] just winds up [*-1] costing the taxpayers <disfluency> a fortune </disfluency> you know a fortune [*PRO*] to keep [*-2] doing that /
<TURN>
the guy 's guilty /
exactly /
</LU_ANNOTATE_WC_=_670>
<TURN>
and the victims you know the family of these people that [*T*-1] have been murdered [*-2] they just have [*-3] to have it dragged [*-4] on for years and years before they ever get any resolution /
<TURN>
exactly /
because it 's not next day [0] they have <disfluency> the start </disfluency> the trial which [*T*-1] is X number of months and just prolongs the situation that much more [*T*-2] /
<TURN>
right /
yeah yeah /
<TURN>
i think <disfluency> that </disfluency> that <disfluency> if it 's </disfluency> if it 's not a split decision uh [*PRO*] go with the highest number and [*PRO*] let 's just get on with the program /
<TURN>
yeah yeah /
<TURN>
uh but as far as the sentencing by the judge i would have [*-1] to vote against that since there 's a jury because that 's what the juries are for [*T*-2] is [*PRO*] to make the decision /
um what are your feelings [*T*-1] /
<TURN>
yeah yeah /
well <disfluency> if i </disfluency> i saw on one of the talk shows this woman judge i believe from Florida /
and she just has just really stiff penalties /
and i saw that <disfluency> in </disfluency> in the hands of a judge that [*T*-1] really was conscientious and really you know took the pains [*PRO*] to give a sentence for what [*T*-2] was deserved [*-3] <disfluency> it could </disfluency> you could have <disfluency> a </disfluency> a judge that [*T*-4] would really make a good impact /
but likewise you could have the flip side and have some judge that [*T*-1] was paid [*-2] off or you know had <disfluency> good </disfluency> a good old boy network or for whatever reasons you know politics just let all kinds of people through /
so <disfluency> he </disfluency> he would have a heck [*RNR*-1] or she would have a heck [*RNR*-1] of a lot of power you know if [*PRO*] used [*-2] wrongly /
so at least the jury system does something [0] [*T*-1] to prevent that you know or help <disfluency> it </disfluency> with it anyway /
i do n't know if it prevents it /
but [*PRO*] seems like the jury system does have its advantages /
but <disfluency> i also </disfluency> i 've also heard on trials that sometimes they go through like three hundred jurors before they hand pick these jurors that they think [0] [*T*-1] are going [*-2] to be the ones that [*T*-3] are going [*-4] to be the most lenient you know /
and i do n't know how much they 're getting just a jury of their peers at that point [*T*-1] /
they 're really getting a select group /
it 's not just random people /
<TURN>
hm /
<TURN>
it almost should be [0] the first twelve people that they you know <disfluency> that </disfluency> have [*T*-1] on a list are the ones that [*T*-2] are on the jury /
and that 's it /
<TURN>
yeah yeah /
i get back to Price 's comment when he uh was found [*-1] [*PRO*-2] guilty [*T*-3] /
he said well he did n't have any blacks uh you know from his neck of the woods /
well [*PRO*] give me a break you know /
<TURN>
you know /
<TURN>
he 'd have [*-1] to have his whole family up there for him to feel like he 's got his peers or something /
yeah /
<TURN>
exactly /
yeah yeah /
i mean <disfluency> you 're </disfluency> you 're in Dallas /
so everybody /-
i ca n't believe [0] they can uh /-
like in a murder situations they look for juries who [*T*-1] do n't know anything about the system well or know anything about <disfluency> the </disfluency> the occurrence /
you 'd have [*-1] to be pretty dense /
<TURN>
yeah /
<TURN>
you 'd <disfluency> be in </disfluency> have [*-1] to be in a cave [*PRO*] not to know what [*T*-2] 's going on /
or [*PRO*] moving it to Lubbock or somewhere possibly is not the answer /
<TURN>
yeah /
oh they 'd have [*-1] to move it to Taiwan for people not to know about it practically /
<TURN>
this is true so true /
well this has been an interesting conversation /
<TURN>
yeah yeah /
well really this <disfluency> is </disfluency> breaks up my afternoon from [*PRO*] changing diapers and mopping floors /
i mean what can i say [*T*-1] /
no i 'm at home with two little kids preschoolers /
my husband works for TI /
<TURN>
oh so you 're at the house /
you 're not at the plant /
oh [*PRO*] hold it /
oh that 's good /
that 's good /
i thought [0] i heard a holler there in the background /
but i was n't sure /
<TURN>
so yeah /
oh yeah i 've got the dog and two kids waiting here /
i am locked [*-1] up in the laundry room /
okay thanks a lot /
bye-bye /
<TURN>
oh goodness /
well i 'll let you get /-
i enjoyed it /
bye /
