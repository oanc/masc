My name is Bonnie Rindner /
and I was born [*-1] in San Antonio , TX , /
and the story [0] I 'm going [*-1] to tell [*T*-2] is about my mother . /
Um , a little background first . /
<disfluency> Her </disfluency> , [*PRO*] let 's see , her mother 's family were wealthy people at one time . /
They owned car dealerships and extensive land . /
Um , I do n't know if they were farmers or not , /
but I know [0] they were land owners , um , many acres /
and , um , her grandmother was raised [*-1] in wealth . /
Uh , then the Depression came /
and apparently everyone lost all their money . /
Um , she was raised [*-1] in MO , /
and she married a man , /
this is my grandmother [0] I 'm talking about [*T*-1] . /
And they were very poor by this point , /
and they had , I think [*?*] , seven children . /
And one particular Christmas , things were very , very difficult . /
There was no money [0] [*T*] to buy any presents at all , um , for the children [*T*-1] , /
and my grandfather , who [*T*-1] was killed [*-2] when my mother was 16 [*T*-3] , this was , of course , way before that , um , he must have been a very positive person because what he did [*T*-4] with the situation was <disfluency> he </disfluency> , he told the children that there were no presents this Christmas because they had given them all to Santa [*PRO*] to take the poor children /
and this made the children feel happy and proud of themselves /
and it [*EXP*-1] gave them a good feeling that they had done something very nice for someone less fortunate than themselves . /
Um , I felt like that was a way [0] [*PRO*] to face that situation with such hope and with joy and with love [*T*-1] . /
And although I never met my grandfather , I have never forgotten that story /
and when I hear of him [*T*-1] I think what a wonderful , wonderful person he must have been [*T*-2] . /

and now we 've been back one year . /
