<TURN>
okay Ellen what kind of a car do you think [0] you 're going [*-1] to buy [*T*-2] /
<TURN>
well as a matter of fact I was thinking about that the other day /
and uh I really do n't know the answer um /
<TURN>
I would sort of like [*PRO*-1] to uh think about something in the way of uh uh sort of a sporty car but <disfluency> not any </disfluency> not you know a luxury type sporty one but um -- <TURN> yeah / <TURN> -- something that [*T*-2] still has a lots of amenities and you know gadgets and things /
<TURN>
oh you do want a lot of that stuff /
<TURN>
yeah well yeah <disfluency> I like </disfluency> I like some of those things /
they come in really handy /
<TURN>
what kind of uh things are you going [*-1] to consider [*T*-2] /
you know what uh you said [*T*-1] /
something <disfluency> about the </disfluency> about the /-
well what do you call them [*PRO*-2] [*T*-1] /
you said amenities -- <TURN> amenities / <TURN> -- that they have [*T*-1] /
but what about um their reputation of the company or the price /
<TURN>
um well of course I guess [0] uh price is always the big consideration /
but -/
<TURN>
it is [*?*] for me /
other people do n't seem [*-1] to have the same problem /
<TURN>
yeah /
<TURN>
well <disfluency> that 's </disfluency> that 's a big one in my book /
but uh um -- <TURN> yeah / <TURN> -- I have preferences <disfluency> for </disfluency> uh for some um makers over others um /
and I would sort of like [*PRO*-1] to buy American /
<TURN>
yeah /
<TURN>
but you know I 'm not so totally hung up on that that I would n't buy something else /
how about you /
<TURN>
well um the last car [0] we bought [*T*-1] was American <disfluency> because of </disfluency> because of that reason /
but [*PRO*] have not been entirely happy with um several things about the car /
it does n't seem like the quality is quite as high as I expected it to be [*?*] -- <TURN> oh really / <TURN> -- because several things minor things sort of -/
but still they cost us money um that we did n't feel like we should have had [*-1] to pay [*T*-2] on a car <disfluency> that </disfluency> that [*T*-3] was that new /
<TURN>
um-hum /
<TURN>
you know we bought the car [*PRO*-1] new /
and after um well well well under two years we had [*-1] to replace the clutch /
<TURN>
oh /
<TURN>
and they just said well you know clutches are disposable /
and I said since when /
brake pads are disposable you know /
we know that /
but I never thought [0] a clutch was disposable /
<TURN>
yeah yeah yeah /
I would n't have thought so either /
<TURN>
yeah so <disfluency> that was </disfluency> that was kind of a shock /
<TURN>
oh /
<TURN>
oh yeah <disfluency> I </disfluency> I guess [0] there 's a lot <disfluency> to </disfluency> [0] [*PRO*] to think about [*T*-1] when you 're trying [*PRO*-2] to make that decision [*T*-3] /
<TURN>
yeah you know <disfluency> the less </disfluency> actually the less [0] you spend [*T*-1] on a car -/
it seems like luxury cars they 're called [*-1] [*PRO*-2] luxury cars even though they 're much more expensive <disfluency> like </disfluency> like uh um a Mercedes Benz they do n't have the history of [*PRO*] breaking down or things like that that [*T*-3] would go wrong would definitely not be considered [*-4] disposable /
<TURN>
right /
<TURN>
you would never think of [*PRO*] having [*-1] to replace the clutch in a Mercedes /
<TURN>
no but then um -/
<TURN>
especially not after two years /
<TURN>
no but on the other hand I guess too uh [0] whenever you do have [*-1] to have some major work done [*-2] on one of those [*T*-3] it costs a fortune /
<TURN>
really /
oh I do n't know /
<TURN>
yeah I 've uh worked with a couple of people who [*T*-1] have owned uh various years uh Mercedes /
and -- <TURN> I think [0] that 's -/ <TURN> I think [0] they have a really good um quality /
<TURN>
um-hum my uh daughter has owned two different ones /
and uh you know we 've had some work done [*-1] on them /
but it 's not too bad /
and <disfluency> the reason </disfluency> one of the reasons [0] we um bought the first one [*T*-1] was because a friend of ours had a Toyota that he just really drove [*T*-2] for years and years and years /
and he lived way out in the country /
so he put a lot of miles on it /
<TURN>
um-hum /
<TURN>
and you knew [0] it had had been through a whole lot /
<TURN>
um-hum /
<TURN>
and yet you know <disfluency> it </disfluency> it held up pretty doggone good /
so -/
<TURN>
yeah /
<TURN>
I thought [0] they would [*?*] /
<TURN>
they seem [*-1] to be really durable /
<TURN>
yeah /
<TURN>
so I do n't know /
<disfluency> I 'm </disfluency> I 'm not ready [*PRO*-1] to buy a new car yet /
but I do n't know <disfluency> if </disfluency> if the next time I 'm going [*-1] to try <disfluency> to </disfluency> [*PRO*-2] to stay with [*PRO*] buying something American or if I 'm going [*-3] to go for a little more what I would consider [*T*-4] to be a long-term investment /
<TURN>
yeah /
<TURN>
well and I guess you know [0] you always have [*-1] to think about things like your gas mileage and stuff like that you know /
you -/
<TURN>
oh it [*EXP*-1] 's easy [*PRO*] to get gas mileage in this car /
it gets excellent gas mileage /
<TURN>
yeah /
yeah that 's one of the big throwing cards for some of the foreign ones /
<TURN>
um-hum /
<TURN>
well we talked long enough /
<TURN>
I think so /
<TURN>
okay /
well [*PRO*] enjoyed it /
bye-bye /
<TURN>
all righty /
thanks /
bye-bye /
