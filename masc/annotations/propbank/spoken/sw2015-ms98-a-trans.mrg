<TURN>
have you ever got one of those calls that [*T*-1] 's either generated [*-2] by a computer or somebody going down a list and they 're either offering a service or they 're introducing some new product in the area /
and normally when they call [*T*-1] you 're either in the shower or you in the middle of [*PRO*-2] cooking something and you had [*-3] to stop everything [*PRO*-4] to run to the phone /
<TURN>
yes yes /
that is that one that you were talking about [*T*-1] /
<TURN>
that was the big one [0] I 'm talking about [*T*-1] /
I work weird hours /
and invariably just about the time [0] I 'm going to sleep [*T*-1] the phone tears off the wall /
<TURN>
uh-huh uh-huh /
<TURN>
and you 're trying [*PRO*-1] to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone /
you either hear the click as soon as you say hello /
you hear the click of the recording coming on /
<TURN>
um-hum /
<TURN>
or you hear somebody already starting <disfluency> reading </disfluency> [*-1] reading off a list of stuff that they 've read [*T*-2] probably a thousand times that day already /
<TURN>
that 's true /
or the ones that [*T*-1] <disfluency> are </disfluency> are generated [*-2] by a computer /
it 's just a computer voice that [*T*-3] comes on the line /
those are the ones that I really really hate [*T*-1] too /
<TURN>
[*PRO*] even had some of them /
<disfluency> the </disfluency> they 're voice activated /
and you 've got [*-1] to say hello twice before they 'll do anything /
<TURN>
uh-huh uh-huh /
yeah sometimes <disfluency> I </disfluency> I get them on my uh answering machine at home /
so -/
and I hate that when I 've got a whole bunch of messages and I go through them and most of them are n't from anybody at all [*T*-1] /
<TURN>
what I would love [*PRO*-1] to see [*T*-2] done [*-3] [*PRO*] to stop all of this -/
<TURN>
uh-huh
<TURN>
we 've got a thing in this country /
you can have your phone number unlisted /
<TURN>
um-hum /
<TURN>
I think [0] a law should be passed [*-1] to where any of these people [*T*-2] -/
I think [0] it [*ICH*-1] 's great <disfluency> that </disfluency> you know freedom of speech in this country and everything /
but if they 're going [*-1] to offer these services or these recorded message everything they ought [*-2] to be stuck [*PRO*-4] working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer [*PRO*-3] to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them /
<TURN>
um-hum /
yeah /
see I have an unlisted telephone number /
but I still get all of those calls /
and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that I do n't even understand [*T*-1] /
so yeah I do [*?*] /
I really feel that that 's uh an invasion of my privacy /
I agree with you on that particular subject there /
[*PRO*] let me see /
<TURN>
that 's about that as far as any other everyday occurrences /
I put a stop to some of them as far as the door-to-door either religious groups or people -- <TURN> um-hum / <TURN> -- peddling products /
if I wanted their products I would 've either gone to the store [*PRO*-1] to bought it /
or I would 've called for their <disfluency> salesman </disfluency> salesman to come out /
<TURN>
um-hum um-hum /
<TURN>
yeah that 's true /
[*PRO*] living in an apartment complex though you know <disfluency> you ca n't </disfluency> um you ca n't really stop those people from [*PRO*-1] coming around even though they put up signs [*ICH*-2] out front that [*T*-3] says no solicitations /
uh but they still come up to the front door and uh you know walk around /
so usually what I do [*T*-1] is I 'll call the apartment manager and tell him hey there 's people coming around you know /
and they 're trying [*PRO*-1] to sell something /
<disfluency> or </disfluency> or they 're from a religious organization /
and I really hate that /
I really really do [*?*] /
I had somebody come to the door about two weeks ago /
and um gosh it was about nine o 'clock at night too /
it was n't even what I would consider [*T*-1] you know a family hour /
it 's time [0] [*PRO*] to you know start [*-1] going to bed [*T*-2] /
<disfluency> and </disfluency> uh and it was somebody from um oh what was it [*T*-1] the uh Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints /
and uh I 've read a lot about uh that particular sect /
and I do n't particularly care for it /
so I especially do n't like for them to come up to my door and try and talk to me /
<TURN>
now I agree with their right [*PRO*] to um pursue their religion of choice in <disfluency> that </disfluency> whatever manner they want [*PRO*-1] to [*?*] [*T*-2] /
but I think [0] they also should respect the sanctity of the American home whether it be in a house or in an apartment /
<TURN>
um-hum /
<TURN>
I 'm on my turf /
if I want them there I 'll call for them /
otherwise I do n't want [*PRO*-1] to know [0] they exist /
<TURN>
right /
<TURN>
yeah yeah /
no <disfluency> I </disfluency> I agree with you there though /
I mean they want [*PRO*-1] to choose that particular religion then that 's fine with me too you know as long as they do n't try and pull me in and drag me in /
<disfluency> and </disfluency> and I do n't like the way that they do it [*T*-1] either /
<disfluency> and </disfluency> and it 's their mission <disfluency> as they do </disfluency> as they go door-to-door /
and they go out into the public /
and they actually have the uh teenagers serving two years like you would say like in an army and two years in [*PRO*] going around and doing missionary type work /
and I do n't know /
<disfluency> I just </disfluency> um I just do n't particularly care for that at all /
and <disfluency> that </disfluency> that 's one thing that I feel really strongly about [*T*-1] though is uh you know people [*ICH*-2] coming up to my door especially religious organizations and wanting [*PRO*-3] <disfluency> to </disfluency> uh you know to try and get me to join or you know become interested in their religion because I have my own /
<TURN>
now the part about where you said [0] the apartment complex puts up signs that [*T*-1] says no soliciting [*T*-2] I 've even gone so far as [*PRO*] to put that /
I 've got a storm door on the front of the house /
and I 've put in -/
I do n't know how much clearer it can be [*T*-1] /
it 's a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting /
I should have guessed /
I guess [0] I should make another one that [*T*-1] says religious or otherwise because I still get -/
<TURN>
yeah yeah that 's true yeah /
no <disfluency> I do n't </disfluency> uh <disfluency> I do n't have </disfluency> I did n't go that far /
but uh yeah I probably could do the same thing uh you know /
I do n't have a storm door /
but I 'm sure [0] I could rig up something /
but you know I do n't think that that would stop people /
I mean it 's like <disfluency> they </disfluency> they see that word and it says uh go instead of stop /
oh goodness /
<TURN>
[*PRO*] wonder if there 'd be some way [0] we could get these people that [*T*-1] do this get their names their addresses and their phone numbers and then reverse it and do -/
well that would be technically illegal /
it 'd be harassment /
<TURN>
oh gosh /
<TURN>
but I consider invasion of my privacy -- <TURN> yeah yeah / <TURN> -- a harassment in itself /
<TURN>
yeah yeah yeah that 's true /
that 's true /
hm well what else /
<TURN>
I believe [0] we 've pretty much summed everything up /
<TURN>
I know /
but I remember [0] <disfluency> you </disfluency> you talked about something /
you started off /
and you said -/
well [*PRO*] let me think /
you talked about the telephone calls people coming and soliciting selling things at the door /
you said something else /
and I ca n't remember what it was [*T*-1] /
and I thought yeah <disfluency> that </disfluency> that kind of touched a nerve right there /
but <disfluency> we got </disfluency> uh we got to [*PRO*-1] talking about the um uh people coming to you at the front door /
<TURN>
I 'm drawing the blank /
<TURN>
oh goodness /
okay is our five minutes up /
<TURN>
uh pretty close to it /
well I 've enjoyed [*PRO*-1] talking with you /
<TURN>
pretty close /
well it [*EXP*-1] was nice [*PRO*] talking to you too Jim /
<TURN>
and [*PRO*] take it easy now /
good night /
<TURN>
okay /
thanks /
bye /
