Hi my name is Sandra Reid /
and I am part of a family of seven children , um , /
and my mom and dad have passed away . /
During our young years we were very poor . /
We did not have very much /
but my mom always found a way [0] [*PRO*] to keep us [*PRO*-1] busy or keep us [*PRO*-2] entertained [*T*-4] , /
and one of the ways that she kept us [*PRO*-1] entertained [*T*-2] was by [*PRO*] telling stories , reading poems , and singing to us . /
One of the stories that I would like [*PRO*-1] to share [*T*-2] with you is the story that [*T*-3] is pretty scary /
and it sticks out into my mind , I guess , <disfluency> mostly </disfluency> , mainly because it was scary . /
Even though my mom told us lot of scary stories she was always there [*PRO*-1] to hold us in her arms and let us know that the story was not true and that <disfluency> it was </disfluency> we were OK . /
Out of all of my sisters and brothers I was the laziest one of all [*T*-1] , as far as [*PRO*] working around the house . /
All of my sisters learned [*PRO*-1] to cook by the age of eight . /
I learned after I got married /
so I was a pretty lazy child when it came down to [*PRO*] cleaning up and cooking [*T*-1] . /
So one night my mother asked me [*PRO*-1] to go inside and wash the dishes . /
Naturally , I start [*-1] crying , /
and one of my main ways of [*PRO*] getting out of work was always saying [0] something hurt me , either my stomach , or that I had a headache , or something was wrong with my leg . /
Just anything [*PRO*] to get out of [*PRO*] doing my job . /
So after she noticed that I was going [*-1] to be just a little stubborn and not <disfluency> follow </disfluency> , do what she tell told me [*PRO*-2] to do [*T*-3] , she asked me [*PRO*-4] to come around in the living room with her and the rest of the family . /
So she began [*-1] to tell this story . /
Once upon a time there was this little girl and her family . /
And the mother asked the little girl [*PRO*-1] to please go in and wash the dishes so that she could go to bed early and not <disfluency> come up </disfluency> , wake up in the morning and see all those dishes on the table . /
And her little girl just complained , " I do n't want [*PRO*-1] to wash the dishes . /
I do n't want [*PRO*-1] to [*?*] . /
My leg hurts , /
my head hurts . /
I do n't feel good . " /
The little girl disappointed her mother so badly , /
but her mother said , " How in the world am I ever going [*-1] to get her to wash these dishes [*T*-2] ? " /
So she said , " Little girl , little girl , if you do n't go in there and wash those dishes like I asked you , something really , really bad is going [*-1] to happen to you . " /
So the little girl just said , " OK I 'll go in there and wash the dishes . " /
And she was in there [*PRO*-1] stomping and crying and mad and taking all her good time . /
All of a sudden the butcher knife came out of the drawer /
and it began [*-1] to roll around in the air . /
And before you know it , the butcher knife came around and cut the little girl 's head off . /
And when the little girl went to heaven [*T*-2] she was crying down to her dad and saying " Daddy , Daddy ! Mama cut my head off with the butcher knife . " /
Now that knife , when I went [*PRO*-1] to sleep [*T*-2] it really scared me . /
But the wonderful thing about it my mom was always there close by [*PRO*-1] to let me know that I was OK . /
Now after that , my mother continued [*-1] to tell us many , many scary stories and tell us many , many , many poems . /
I 'd like [*PRO*-1] to tell you about how I got into [*PRO*-3] becoming a teacher 's assistant [*T*-2] . /
All my life I always wanted [*PRO*-1] to be a teacher even from the time [0] I started to school [*T*-2] . /
That [*ICH*-1] was my dream , [*PRO*] to teach school . /
As I told you [*?*] , in the past we were a very poor family /
and I never got the chance [*PRO*] to go to college because of this . /
Uh , while I was in high school a teacher of mine noticed that I had an extra bone in my foot /
and she said , " Well now Sandra we can use this as get toward , on your grant [*PRO*] to go to college . " /
So she said , " [*PRO*] Go home /
and [*PRO*] talk to your mother about it /
and [*PRO*] see if we , you know , can follow through with [*PRO*] applying for a <disfluency> grant </disfluency> , scholarship grant for you . " /
So that night I went home /
and I asked my mother about it /
and she said , " Baby , I really want you to go to college . /
It [*ICH*-1] 's always been my dream that my children all go to school . /
But because there are so many children in the family there are other things [0] you 're going [*-1] to have [*-2] to have [*T*-3] [*PRO*-1] to go to school /
and I just do n't have the money . " /
At that time my dad was in prison at the time , /
so it made it really hard for my mom . /
I sat there /
and I cried /
but I tried [*PRO*-1] to be as understanding as possible because I knew [0] my mother struggled really hard [*PRO*-2] to even keep food on the table for us . /
So I never got a chance [*PRO*] to go to school . /
<TURN>
Did anybody [*?*] ? /
<TURN>
Yes , my brother went to school . /
He went to Livingstone and then <disfluency> to </disfluency> transferred to Johnson C. Smith , <disfluency> so </disfluency> [*PRO*] to make it easier on my mom , <disfluency> to </disfluency> , as far as , you know , him staying at home and going to school too . /
So he graduated from , um , Johnson C. Smith , here in Charlotte . /
I had another sister who [*T*-1] went to Gaston College where she got a business degree there [*T*-2] . /
<disfluency> I </disfluency> , in later years , I went on to college some /
but I did n't complete the , uh , whole four years . /
Um , I remember once , when I was working in a mill , and I was spinning yarn , and I was saying to myself , and , I was praying actually [*T*-1] , and I said , " God , one day I want [*PRO*-2] to work in the school system . /
If I could just work , even as a teacher assistant I would be happy . " /
As the years went by my prayer was answered [*-1] /
and I got the chance [*PRO*] to work in the cafeteria as a cashier /
and the principal there came up to me and said , " Have you considered [*PRO*-1] being a teacher assistant ? " /
I said , " I would love [*PRO*-1] to [*?*] . " /
So they told me about some classes that I could take [*T*-1] at Central Piedmont . /
I 'd never gone to college before . /
I was really afraid . /
But he told me [*PRO*-1] to go ahead and try it , /
so I took the entrance test , /
and they accepted me <disfluency> into </disfluency> at the school , /
and I took some courses there . /
After a while , the principal said , " I would like for you to bring me your , um , transcript so I can see what your grades are like [*T*-1] . " /
Luckily I had all As . /
I did very well . /
And he asked me [*PRO*-1] to be a teacher assistant the next following year . /
Um , <disfluency> my dream </disfluency> , my prayers were answered [*-1] . /
I enjoy my job very much . /
I ca n't think of any job that [*T*-1] would make me any happier . /
A few years later , um , I had the opportunity [*PRO*] to apply for a scholarship [*PRO*] to further my education . /
At first I did n't want [*PRO*-1] to apply for it , /
but the principal called me during the summer months and said , " Sandra the time is running out , /
you need [*-1] to apply . " /
And he told me [0] I would have [*-1] to write this paper . /
Well I did n't like [*PRO*] writing at the time /
but I took it [*EXP*-1] upon myself [*PRO*] to go ahead and write a paper . /
And I went to , um , one of my staff members /
and I asked her if she would proofread it , /
and she thought [0] it was an excellent paper . /
And I went ahead and mailed it in [*PRO*] thinking uh [0] I wo n't get the scholarship . /
Who [*T*-1] cares ? /
I do n't [*?*] , /
just so I can work in the school I 'll be happy . /
But one day I came in /
and I looked at my mail /
and I was accepted [*-1] . /
I could n't believe it . /
Out of 150 assistants who [*T*-2] had applied for this grant only 16 [*T*-1] got the opportunity , /
so I felt very proud of myself . /
So I went on and took the courses , /
and as I started I think [0] I was taking economics . /
I think [0] that was the last class [0] I took [*T*-1] . /
My husband became very ill with cancer /
and I had [*-1] to make a decision as to whether I would continue my education or take care of him /
and I felt like I needed [*-1] to take care of him because he stood by me so much while I was going to school . /
<TURN>
But you would have been able [*PRO*-1] to be <disfluency> a </disfluency> , a teacher if you had continued ? /
<TURN>
Yeah , /
and at the time , I was also working in the classroom . I guess [0] you 'd say as a sub because the teacher that I was working with [*T*-1] at that time was pregnant and she had [*-2] to take a leave of absence . /
And they hired a sub /
but the sub did n't do that much . /
I had [*-1] to take over the classroom . /
So I worked maybe like four months in the classroom /
and that highly put a damper on my wanting [*PRO*] to be a teacher from all the responsibility along with the fact that I was taking care of a very sick husband . /
<disfluency> After all of this was </disfluency> , after <disfluency> I </disfluency> , I decided [*PRO*-1] not to continue I 've never pursued the fact of [*PRO*] going back to school . /
I just got to a certain age /
and I said , " No I ca n't do this anymore , " /
so I never went back . /
But I love what I do [*T*-1] /
and , uh , anytime [0] I get a chance [*PRO*] to teach in a classroom [*T*-1] I go for it /
so . /-
<TURN>
How many different schools did you teach at [*T*-1] ? /
<TURN>
I 've only worked at <disfluency> two </disfluency> , two schools . /
The first school [0] I worked at [*T*-1] was Enderly Park /
and then it was closed [*-1] down . /
So I was in those situations where I <disfluency> first </disfluency> , <disfluency> come first </disfluency> , <disfluency> transfer last </disfluency> , come first [*PRO*] to transfer out [*T*-1] .
So I had [*-1] to [*?*] , /
I was offered [*-1] a job at Ashley Park or Berryhill /
and I chose Berryhill . /
I did n't particularly want [*PRO*-1] to come here /
and when I came here [*T*-1] everybody noticed that I was really , really sad because I loved [*PRO*-2] being at Enderly Park . /
But then , after a while , I fell in love with Berryhill . /
If I 'm not mistaken I think [0] I 've been at Berryhill for I think 17 years , /
17 , 18 years I 've been here at Berryhill /
so /-
and I hope [0] I never have [*-1] to leave until I retire . /
<TURN>
And why did the other school close down [*T*-1] ? /
<TURN>
Um , <disfluency> the </disfluency> , you know , I really do n't know . /
Um , <disfluency> that </disfluency> , I really do n't know why they closed that school down [*T*-1] because it was a really nice school and everything , /
but they eventually tore it down because /-
<disfluency> I was there </disfluency> I think [0] the first year [0] I went there [*T*-1] was the year [0] they built a really nice gym [*T*-2] , /
and I do n't think [0] they used that gym no more than three years . /
I really do n't [*?*] , /
I do n't remember why that school was ever closed [*-2] [*T*-1] /
but it was [*?*] . /
And I enjoy what I do [*T*-1] . /
That 's it . /
<TURN>
All right [*PRO*] thank you . /
<TURN>
[*PRO*] Thank you . /
