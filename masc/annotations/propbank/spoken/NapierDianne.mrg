I would say [0] between the ages of 7 to 10 years old it [*EXP*-1] was a really big thing [*T*] to go to the movie on Saturday mornings . /
And one particular movie theater [0] we went to [*T*-1] , they would show serials [*ICH*-2] every Saturday , which [*T*-3] were a continued story . /
So if you missed one Saturday you would miss what [*T*-1] happened in a particular episode , and you , um , would n't know what [*T*-2] had taken place . /
So we would go every Saturday morning . /
And also at this theater , they gave prizes to different people . /
And one of the way [0] they gave prizes [*T*-1] was , [0] they would take big group photos and everybody , /-
and there were stairs going up to a balcony , real wide stairs . /
And the big group of people would go [*PRO*-1] stand on the stairs /
and there would be probably 30 or 40 kids in the picture . /
And they 'd take the picture /
and then you would go back the next Saturday after they had been developed [*-1] /
and they would have circled 3 or 4 people in the picture /
and the people whose head [*T*-1] was circled [*-2] would get the prizes . /
<TURN>
Is that for real ? /
<TURN>
That 's for real ! /
That really happened ! /
And one time [0] I can remember [*T*-1] , I think [0] it was Steve , my brother , um , /
he , /-
and they would give treats like candy , /
I do n't even remember what all kinds of prizes they would give [*T*-1] . /
But for some reason , and I think [0] this is really true , he got ice cream sandwiches ! /
Like a box of ice cream sandwiches . /
And of course there 's nothing [0] [*T*] to do [*T*-1] with a box of ice cream sandwiches when you 're at a 2 - hour movie [*T*-2] ! /
They 're going [*-1] to melt ! /
And another , um , /-
<disfluency> that was in , </disfluency> that was in High Point , NC. /
And then we moved to Charlotte /
and we used [*-1] to go to -- and I do n't think [0] it 's even still there I do n't know if the building is or not -- but the Dilworth Theatre . /
I lived in the Dilworth area , /
and we would go to the Dilworth Theatre /
and I do remember that it [*EXP*-1] cost 9 cents [*PRO*] to get a ticket [*PRO*] to get in . /
And we <disfluency> would </disfluency> , could go to the movie . /
We would get maybe 15 cents each [*PRO*-1] to go to the movie , /
and I sound like I 'm 95 years old -- with those kinds of prices . /
Um , but we would go to the movie /
and then you would go in and get <disfluency> your </disfluency> , your snack that you wanted [*T*-1] . /
And there were several different choices . /
I do n't ever remember [*PRO*-1] getting popcorn at the movie until I was a teenager or in my adult life . /
But we would , uh , buy , /-
lollipops is what they call them [*PRO*-1] [*T*-2] now , /
but we called them [*PRO*-1] suckers /
and we would get often a 2 - cent sucker . /
<TURN>
Are you making fun ? /
<TURN>
No , I love this story . /
And the 2 - cent suckers is what [*T*-1] is referred to [*-2] now as a Tootsie Roll Pop . /
And we called them [*PRO*-1] 2 - cent suckers because every other sucker cost a penny . /
Except these were 2 cents because they had the Tootsie Roll in the middle . /
And there was one other sucker that [*T*-1] cost a nickel /
and we called that [*PRO*-1] an all day sucker , just because you could n't eat the whole thing for the entire movie and you would really just have that sucker all day long . /
And one other form of refreshment that we got [*T*-1] , which [*T*-2] really embarrassed my mother because she did n't know anything about this until she went with us to the movie one Saturday , /-
there was a bakery next door to the movie theatre . /
And my brothers and myself were not the only people that [*T*-1] did this ; /
all the kids that [*T*-1] would go to the movie knew [*PRO*-2] to do this . /
We would go into the bakery /
and we would ask for -- a nickel worth of scraps ! /
And we did n't even have [*-1] to ask for it because the bakery lady knew us and she knew [*PRO*-2] to have all this ready for all the kids going to the movie . /
And what it was [*T*-1] it was broken cookies and broken pieces of whatever [*T*-2] happened while they were baking , mistakes . /
So they would fill little bags for us /
and we would give them a nickel /
and we could take that to the movie theatre with us . /
And that 's all the stories [0] I can remember [*T*-1] about the movies right now . /
I do know that I did used [*-1] to go the movie downtown at the Carolina Theatre . /
And when I was young [*T*-1] , it [*EXP*-2] was n't a strange thing for the kids to just go off and go to a movie . /
I mean , my mother knew where we were going [*T*-1] /
and she knew when we would get back [*T*-1] , /
but today you would n't send your seven or eight year old child to a movie theatre alone even if they were with their nine year old brother ; /
you just would n't do it . /
And we could skate to the movie or ride a bicycle to the movie /
and we would do that . Which [*T*-1] is kind of sad that you ca n't do that anymore /
and it 's not just because <disfluency> things are </disfluency> , there 're bad people in the world but it 's too much traffic . /
You have [*-1] to check everything about a movie , check it out [*PRO*-2] to see what the content is [*T*-3] /
and [*PRO*] just was n't like that when I was growing up [*T*-1] . /
Also about that same time period in my life , I guess again between seven and ten years old , which [*T*-1] seems [*-2] to be what I remember [*T*-3] most vividly , my best friend uh , was Kathy Josey , /
and she was a next door neighbor also , /
and we remained friends up until , uh , she was about 35 /
and she passed away with cancer . /
But <disfluency> we </disfluency> , we remained close friends . /
In fact we shared an apartment , first apartment [0] either one of us ever had [*T*-1] . /
And when we were , um , little girls [*T*-1] we used [*-2] to play " Career Girls " ! /
We did [*?*] ! /
And we used [*-1] to try [*PRO*-2] to dress up and pretend [0] we were businesswomen . /
And we would go to work and pretend [0] we had an apartment together /
and then when we grew up [*T*-1] , we sure did [*?*] ; /
we got an apartment . /
<TURN>
Uh-huh . /
<TURN>
Um , Kathy and I also used [*-1] to play other kind of dress ups /
and <disfluency> it just </disfluency> , <disfluency> it seems like </disfluency> , I remember [0] we both had like our mother 's long skirts , /
or the skirts would be long on us /
and we would literally wear dress up clothes that [*T*-1] belonged to our mothers . /
But <disfluency> we had </disfluency> , Kathy had one pair of pearls or beads of some sort of necklace that [*T*-1] was her mother 's /
and I did n't have the necklace . /
And it was really beautiful /
and I really , really wanted one . /
So we only had the one necklace /
and <disfluency> we </disfluency> , er , we decided , /-
I do n't know if it was [*?*] jointly or if Kathy was just extremely nice or whatever , /
but she said [0] I could wear it part of the time . /
And we would literally time the amount of time [0] we wore it [*T*-1] like 30 minutes or 15 minutes or whatever . /
And the way [0] we decided who [*T*-1] got [*PRO*-2] to wear it first [*T*-3] , /-
and this always kind of bothered me because I know [0] Kathy did this intentionally , /
she said [0] the youngest one got [*PRO*-1] to wear it first /
and she was like six months younger than I am [*?*] . /
So , <disfluency> it </disfluency> , that became a normal thing with us . /
Whenever we only had one of something [*T*-1] she would always say , " Well , I think [0] the youngest one gets [*PRO*-2] to do it , or wear it or whatever first . " /
And , that just always stuck in my mind , that <disfluency> in </disfluency> , in our adult life I brought that up to her /
and she sort of acted like she did n't know anything about that /
and I thought to myself , " she does [*?*] , " /
and then she laughed about it /
and she realized that she had kinda held a trump card on that one . /
Um , also we did a lot of pretending /
and as I said [*?*] we played career girls and the dress ups . /
And my sister and I used [*-1] to pretend also /
and Jill is about 2 [*ICH*-1] years younger than I am [*?*] , maybe two and a half , /
and we used [*-1] to play Robin Hood except we did n't have a Maid Marion , /
we had a Saretha , /
I do n't know where in the world that name came from [*T*-1] . /
But we would switch playing Robin Hood , /
one would play Robin Hood /
and one would play Saretha . /
And Saretha was the counter , /
[*PRO*] would be the same thing as Maid Marion , /
and , <disfluency> why </disfluency> , again , I do n't know why we did n't use Maid Marion [*T*-1] . /
But in my mind I can remember [*PRO*-1] playing that , like all day long . /
And we would go over to my grandparents ' /
and they had <disfluency> a </disfluency> a big white house with a big front porch and , uh , banisters on it and a lot of rocking chairs out on the front porch . /
And it was just a great place [0] [*PRO*] to pretend [*T*-1] /
and we would climb up on the porch and on the banisters /
and we could make those our horses /
or , uh , it could be a castle ; /
just do many things with it . /
Um , and when we were still living in High Point [*T*-1] in our back yard we had a huge , /-
I do n't know , /
I guess [0] it was an oak tree , /
but it was a really big tree , /
but it was a climbable tree . /
And it had real large , thick branches extending out to the side /
and they were fat enough branches where as a child of eight and nine years old we could straddle the branches [*T*-1] . /
And that was another game that Jill and I used [*-1] to play [*T*-2] ; /
we would pretend [0] we were in the jungle /
and we would climb up on the tree /
and we would straddle the tree branches and pretend [0] it was our elephant . /
And in the yard , we had an old tree that [*T*-1] had been cut [*-2] down /
and just the stump was remaining /
and my mother had planted , um , flowers all around that stump /
and we would use that stump <disfluency> as a </disfluency> , as a throne /
and the princess got [*PRO*-1] to sit up on that stump on that throne and have all those flowers around her /
and that would be the throne /
and she would be the queen or the princess or whatever . /
When I was a teenager [*T*-1] , an Audrey Hepburn movie [*ICH*-2] came out called [*] [*PRO*-3] [*PRO*] Wait Until Dark . /
And I think [0] I was probably 16 or 17 years old ; /
we were of driving age . /
And I had a group of girlfriends that I ran around with [*T*-1] /
and <disfluency> there were </disfluency> , golly , there might 've been 8 to 10 of us who [*T*-1] were good friends . /
Everybody had their own " best " friend /
but then we had one big group that [*T*-2] we used [*-1] to do a lot of things together . /
Um , and we <disfluency> would </disfluency> , had that many girls /
but we would only go out in a couple of cars /
and I remember one of the girls , Betty Belle , /
her dad had a VW Beetle , /
and we 'd fit like 5 girls in that VW Beetle . /
<TURN>
Did Betty Belle turn Catholic ? /
<TURN>
No , huh-uh . /
<TURN>
She did n't [*?*] ? /
<TURN>
No . /
So we went out one night to the movie , /
but before we went to the movie we went [*PRO*-1] to get pizza /
and then we went to ,
and I think [0] the name of the place was The Open Kitchen , /
and we did n't have chain pizza places [*ICH*-1] like we do [*?*] now , like Pizza Hut and all that . /
This was just a really neat pizza place that all the kids would go [*T*-1] . /
And we went to Open Kitchen /
and we would have eight or 10 girls /
and we would order one pizza and all share it /
and everyone would only get one piece /
and I think [0] we would make the waitresses mad because we did n't have money [*PRO*-1] to leave tips . /
We would also drink water . /
So it was n't a good situation for the waitresses , /
but we had fun /
and we did n't even think about it . /
We just did what we could get away with [*T*-1] . /
Anyway , that night we were gon [*-1] na go [*PRO*-2] see [*PRO*] Wait Until Dark /
and I think [0] it was on at the Manor Theatre , /
and I just remember [0] when you have like 10 or so girls going <disfluency> somewhere </disfluency> to the same place [*T*-1] it 's <disfluency> kind of a </disfluency> , pretty much of a spectacle ; /
we 're all in this long line /
and we 're giggling and laughing and cutting up and having really a great time . /
So we bought our tickets /
and we went into the Manor Theatre /
and we found a row of seats /
and we <disfluency> sat </disfluency> , <disfluency> file </disfluency> , all filed in . /
<disfluency> And I just remember seeing </disfluency> , and I was sitting in a middle section , /
I was not on an end so I had girls [0] I knew [*T*-1] on both sides of me . /
And I just remember [0] that movie <disfluency> was </disfluency> , had a lot of hype about [*PRO*] being really scary and suspenseful /
and it 's nothing like these movies that [*T*-1] are out today like Scream and , what is it [*T*-2] ? Nightmare on Elm Street whatever it is [*T*-3] , where they 're actual horror movies [*T*-4] . /
This was , uh , a real intense , um , drama and , just very scary ; /
[*PRO*] kept you on the edge of your seat . /
And there was a scene in the movie [0] I remember [*T*-1] where every one of us , and it was n't just our group , but so many people in the theatre , they screamed out at one time [*T*-2] . /
And that 's really all [0] I remember [*T*-1] about that night , /
it was just a lot of fun . /
And I really hope that my daughters have had some nights like that and has had good times like that , that I can remember [*T*-1] [*PRO*-2] going out with good friends . /
