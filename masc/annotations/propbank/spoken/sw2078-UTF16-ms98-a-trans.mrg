<TURN>
here goes [*T*-1] Sharon /
<TURN>
okay /
<TURN>
well what do you think [*T*-1] about Nolan Ryan being the first baseball player [0] [*T*-2] to earn a million dollars /
that 's the only thing [0] I found [*T*-1] out tonight /
<TURN>
oh you found that out tonight /
I had n't even heard that /
that 's great /
I think [0] he deserves every penny of it /
<TURN>
yeah yeah /
<TURN>
but there are some others out there that I do n't believe [0] [*T*-1] deserve the money [0] they 're getting [*T*-2] /
<TURN>
well is n't it [*EXP*-1] funny how baseball 's getting less than like football players would [*?*] [*T*-2] /
<TURN>
oh yeah /
<TURN>
[*PRO*] wonder because football -/
<TURN>
and <disfluency> they play a lot </disfluency> they play a lot longer season too /
<TURN>
and a lot more games [*PRO*] right /
<TURN>
yep that 's exactly right /
<TURN>
uh-huh /
<TURN>
but I think -/
[*PRO*] let 's see /
the teams that [*T*-1] were there last year were see somebody from California /
I do n't even know who [*T*-1] won the pennant last year /
<TURN>
[*PRO*] beats me /
I mean I know [0] Yankees have won a lot of games through the years /
<TURN>
yeah /
not lately though /
<TURN>
we have been talking about this /
I tried [*PRO*-1] to call earlier /
<TURN>
uh-huh /
<TURN>
and we had made a list of all these uh baseball teams and the cities that they were from [*T*-1] /
then I started [*-1] cleaning /
and I do n't know where I even put that paper [*T*-1] /
<disfluency> I </disfluency> yeah I was just cleaning and throwing -/
<TURN>
[*PRO*] threw it away /
oh gosh [*PRO*] let 's see /
the teams that I think -/
the A's [*ICH*-1] were in it last year the Oakland A's /
and I think [0] it was -/
I do n't think [0] it was an all California baseball /
<TURN>
well have you ever played baseball /
<TURN>
I play softball /
<TURN>
well that 's what I did [*T*-1] when I was growing up [*T*-2] /
<TURN>
yeah /
<TURN>
that was fun /
<TURN>
yeah that 's fun /
that 's a whole different sport /
<TURN>
uh-huh /
<TURN>
yeah /
[*PRO*] let 's see /
but <disfluency> I think </disfluency> I think [0] the Rangers need [*-1] to go /
and I think [0] the Pirates will go /
and uh [*PRO*] let 's see /
Rangers have got a new guy this year /
I do n't remember his name either /
<TURN>
do you ever go [*PRO*-1] see the Rangers /
<TURN>
every once in a while /
<disfluency> I </disfluency> I like [*PRO*-1] to go on the nights when there 's <disfluency> not anybody out there </disfluency> not very many people out there [*T*-2] /
it 's a lot more fun when you 're not fighting a crowd [*T*-1] /
<TURN>
yeah I think [0] it 's fun /
I like just looking at the billboards /
<TURN>
yeah /
but sometimes <disfluency> when I </disfluency> if you go out there during the day you just fry under the sun /
<TURN>
yeah it 's nice at night /
<TURN>
yeah /
<TURN>
that 's when I 've been [*T*-1] /
<TURN>
it is [*?*] /
<TURN>
<disfluency> and </disfluency> and do you know anything about that new stadium /
have you seen all those pictures that they 're going [*-1] to put [*T*-2] out there /
<TURN>
well no /
<TURN>
yeah <disfluency> that </disfluency> <disfluency> that huge </disfluency> it 's suppose [*-1] to be a huge stadium /
and it 's going [*-1] to have little shopping centers in it and little like a lake or something running through it /
and uh they 're going [*-1] to try [*PRO*-2] to make it a real community center out there /
<TURN>
and you 're going [*-1] to be able [*PRO*-2] to buy your -/
what was -/
no [*PRO*] wait /
<TURN>
of course /
<TURN>
what was it [*T*-1] about the liquor /
<TURN>
<disfluency> that 's </disfluency> that 's in uh Texas stadium where the football players play [*T*-1] /
<TURN>
was that -/
<TURN>
oh yeah /
see you just -/
<TURN>
and they 're never going [*-1] to let liquor in there /
<TURN>
well they 're trying /
<TURN>
I know /
but they try every year /
and every year they get thrown out /
it 's so stupid because they let you take it in there /
but <disfluency> they do n't </disfluency> they <disfluency> do n't allow you to sell it </disfluency> do n't allow them to sell it there /
<TURN>
uh-huh /
<TURN>
but uh that new stadium 's going [*-1] to be real nice /
and I heard <disfluency> that there 's </disfluency> uh that you can bid on that stadium /
last night on the news I heard [0] they said [0] <disfluency> you could </disfluency> you could bid on the stadium [*PRO*] to have it named [*-1] after you /
<TURN>
kind of right /
<TURN>
<disfluency> it 's going [*-1] to </disfluency> it 's going [*-2] to go to the highest bidder /
<TURN>
oh /
<TURN>
well that 's the way [0] [*PRO*] to do it [*T*-1] /
<TURN>
so -/
yeah /
so that could be your you know fifteen minutes of fame /
<TURN>
you hear that /
that 's my kids turning on their music /
[*PRO*] let me see /
Holly [*PRO*] turn it down /
<TURN>
oh /
<TURN>
I think [0] it 's the Bartman the Simpsons /
<TURN>
oh God I stay away from them /
<TURN>
I wish [0] I could [*?*] /
<TURN>
I bet [0] you do [*?*] /
<TURN>
and you get tired of that /
<TURN>
yeah /
that 's typical bureaucracy though /
<disfluency> that 's </disfluency> <disfluency> that 's </disfluency> I think [0] it 's going [*-1] to be any where [0] you go [*T*-2] /
it 's just worse in the bigger cities than it is [*?*] in the smaller ones /
I do n't know /
sometimes the smaller ones are just as bad /
<TURN>
yeah /
well but they ca n't be [*?*] though /
they do n't have as much money /
<TURN>
yeah /
but <disfluency> the politics </disfluency> the politics gets worse in the small towns sometimes /
<TURN>
most the time /
oh man /
but in Dallas you do n't even know who [*T*-1] 's <disfluency> in </disfluency> in administration /
there 's so many of them /
<TURN>
you do n't even know who [*PRO*] to pay off [*T*-1] huh /
<TURN>
I mean somebody walks in the classroom /
and you do n't know what they 're there for [*T*-1] you know when they 're coming [*T*-2] how long they 're going [*-3] to be [*T*-4] /
<TURN>
yeah /
oh how funny /
<TURN>
you know it 's just them /
there they are [*T*-1] /
and they 're writing the whole time /
<TURN>
no communication whatsoever /
<TURN>
no /
I had them walk out of my class and not say their name anything /
and I finally got to where I go okay I 'm Debbie Moore you know may I ask who you are [*T*-1] and what you are in my classroom for [*T*-2] [*T*-5] you know because you know you never know where they 're going [*T*-3] what they 'll report [*T*-4] or -/
<TURN>
yeah /
I know /
<TURN>
and they 'll tell you [0] they 've written something down /
and you -- <TURN> <disfluency> and you have n't </disfluency> <disfluency> you </disfluency> and you never see it / <TURN> -- hope [0] they 're telling you /
<TURN>
no huh-uh /
<TURN>
that 's got [*-1] to be frustrating /
<TURN>
oh it is [*?*] /
<TURN>
how long have you <disfluency> taught </disfluency> taught Dallas schools [*T*-1] /
<TURN>
uh this is my eleventh year /
<TURN>
ooh that 's about uh ten too many /
<TURN>
no actually it 's -/
now my job 's good much better than a lot -/
<TURN>

uh-huh /
<TURN>
because I 'm Chapter One and all [0] I do [*T*-1] is [*PRO*] teach reading all day long /
<TURN>
yeah /
oh /
<TURN>
and it 's just ten children at a time /
<TURN>
well that 's not bad /
<TURN>
no it 's good /
and you 've got a lot of federal money too /
<TURN>
but has n't it changed a lot over the years /
<TURN>
teaching /
oh yes /
<TURN>
yeah /
or [*PRO*] working in the system /
<TURN>
yes /
when I first started [*-1] teaching [*T*-2] I remember [0] [*T*-6] I went up to my job and I said okay I want [*PRO*-3] to see a curriculum guide you know so I 'll know what I 'm suppose [*-4] to teach [*T*-5] /
and they go we do n't have one of -/
we do n't even know where one is [*T*-1] /
<TURN>

<TURN>

I mean <disfluency> you just </disfluency> you did what you wanted [*PRO*-1] to do [*T*-2] /
<TURN>
oh how funny /
<TURN>
and now they tell you what [*PRO*] to teach [*T*-1] and how long and you know what day -- <TURN> yeah <disfluency> you do n't know which [*T*-1] is </disfluency> you do n't know which [*T*-2] is worse / <TURN> -- what period /
yeah /
no I know which [*T*-1] is worse /
<TURN>

so -/
yeah [*PRO*] being told [*-1] what [*PRO*] to do [*T*-2] is worse /
<TURN>
um-hum /
<TURN>
so how long are we suppose [*-1] to talk for [*T*-2] /
<TURN>
well you can talk for ten minutes /
but you do n't have [*-1] to [*?*] /

<TURN>

but the topic was boring I thought [0] [*T*-1] /
what would you serve [*T*-1] uh if you were having a dinner party /
<TURN>
oh /
oh gosh /
<TURN>
what was -/
I 'm trying [*PRO*-1] to remember /

it was um about movies you know <disfluency> who </disfluency> what have you seen [*T*-1] at the movies lately and stuff like that /
<TURN>

I could go on and on about that /
<TURN>

I mean it was just more for my money /
<TURN>
<disfluency> I </disfluency> I did [*?*] too /
yeah /
I did n't think [0] it was too long at all /

<disfluency> it 's </disfluency> <disfluency> it 's not </disfluency> it 's not too cool for kids /
<TURN>

just massive rental /
<TURN>
oh yeah /
you bring -/
<disfluency> that 's </disfluency> well heck that 's a lot cheaper than uh [*PRO*] taking them out to the show -- <TURN> [*PRO*] going to -/ I know / <TURN> -- especially if you get them for a couple of nights /
you do n't have [*-1] to watch them all at <disfluency> one night </disfluency> one time /
<TURN>
that 's what we do [*T*-1] especially when it 's bad weather man [*T*-2] /

<TURN>
of course you have [*-1] to get there early if you want [*PRO*-2] to get anything -- <TURN> I know / <TURN> -- decent /
