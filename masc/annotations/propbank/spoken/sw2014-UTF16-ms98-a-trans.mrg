<TURN>
uh how do you feel about gun control [*T*-1] /
<TURN>
uh on the scale [0] they gave [*T*-1] one to ten I 'd say [0] I 'm probably a four [*T*-2] /
<disfluency> I 'm not totally </disfluency> I 'm not one of these people that [*T*-1] believes that we should not be able [*PRO*-2] to buy guns /
but I do n't think [0] we should be carrying Uzis either /
you know what I mean [*T*-1] /
yeah I know /
I mean I do n't think /-
machine guns automatic weapons I do n't believe in things like that /
<TURN>
but I think -- <TURN> some people do I know [0] [*T*-1] / <TURN> -- that everyone should have the right [*PRO*] to have a hand gun in their house if they so choose /
<disfluency> and </disfluency> but I think [0] there should be some restrictions when you buy one [*T*-1] you know /
they should do more background search on you /
they should [*?*] /
I think [0] it [*EXP*-1] should be harder [*PRO*] to buy one
<TURN>
right /
<TURN>
yeah there 's a lot of crazies out there that [*T*-1] can just go in and buy a gun because they do n't really ask a lot of questions when you walk into those stores [*T*-2] /
<TURN>
yeah /
<TURN>
no they do n't [*?*] /
they do n't ask anything except how old you are [*T*-1] I do n't think /
that 's kind of scary /
<TURN>
I 'm from California /
<disfluency> my mom </disfluency> the last time [0] I <disfluency> was </disfluency> like purchased a gun [*T*-1] <disfluency> my </disfluency> my mom was getting a rifle for my brother that he wanted [*T*-2] like an antique one /
and -- <TURN> uh-huh / <TURN> -- <disfluency> they </disfluency> he had [*-1] to fill out some forms /
but I guess [0] California might be tougher /
I do n't know /
<TURN>
yeah they might be [*?*] /
or you know how we are here in Texas [*T*-1] /
it 's like everybody 's a hunter so /-
I 'm not much of a hunter /
but -- <TURN> yeah / <TURN> -- it 's /-
<TURN>
I 've never even bought a gun myself /
my dad 's given it to me /
or someone 's given me one /
so I 'm probably real illegal you know [*PRO*-1] carrying guns that [*T*-2] are n't even mine /
<TURN>
yeah <disfluency> it 's a </disfluency> it 's a hard decision [0] [*PRO*] to make [*T*-1] /
<TURN>
it really is [*?*] /
uh the only problem [*ICH*-2] [0] I have [*T*-1] with gun control is that <disfluency> they </disfluency> the radicals wan [*PRO*-3] na ban all kinds of weapons and then the only people carrying guns are gon [*-4] na <disfluency> be </disfluency> be the people who [*T*-5] are gon [*-6] na kill you anyway /
<TURN>
like the bumper sticker /
it 's true yeah /
<TURN>
yeah exactly right /
it really is [*?*] because they 're gon [*-1] na get them one way or another /
they will always have a way /
[*PRO*] look at drugs /
they always have a way [0] [*PRO*] to get that [*T*-1] so /-
<TURN>
right /
right /
right /
<TURN>
and they 're illegal /
so I do n't think [0] it [*EXP*-1] would do us any good [*PRO*] to outlaw them all together
<TURN>
no <disfluency> I </disfluency> yeah <disfluency> I I I I </disfluency> I agree that it would be like [0] <disfluency> people in </disfluency> people that [*T*-1] are uh criminals are the ones that [*T*-2] are gon [*-3] na get them /
and then you have no defense against these people when they do come into your house or something [*T*-1] /
<TURN>
right /
that 's true /
I think [0] they ought [*-1] to teach people how [*PRO*] to shoot them [*T*-2] too how [*PRO*] to take care of one [*T*-3] how [*PRO*] to act around one [*T*-4] when they buy them [*T*-5] /
<TURN>
yeah I <disfluency> have have </disfluency> <disfluency> gun gun </disfluency> <disfluency> have </disfluency> have gun management 101 /
<TURN>
right yeah exactly /
you can not take the gun home until you 've taken this course /
[*PRO*] sign up here /
something like that /
<TURN>
yeah /
or <disfluency> required required </disfluency> required [*] for every college student oh /
<TURN>
right /
exactly /
before graduation /
<TURN>
God gun control /
<disfluency> it 's </disfluency> it 's such a heated topic in <disfluency> the </disfluency> the /-
and people get so emotional about it
<TURN>
yep /
oh yeah they do [*?*] /
they get real emotional about it all the /-
I 've worked with a lot of people that [*T*-1] hunt
and <disfluency> they just </disfluency> <disfluency> they </disfluency> they do n't see any sense in it at all /
they think [0] it [*EXP*-1] 's ridiculous [*PRO*] to have any kind of gun control /
but then of course they 're hunters /
they know what they 're doing [*T*-1] /
they do n't realize [0] there 're a bunch of crazy people out there that /-
<TURN>
some of them are crazy too /
whew yeah yeah /
they go out there and get drunk and start [*-1] shooting /
<TURN>
[*PRO*] do n't use it for that /
well yeah that 's true /
they shoot each other [*PRO*-1] thinking [0] they 're a deer /
yeah /
darn I thought [0] you were a deer Bob /
sorry my mistake /
<TURN>
yeah Marge I do n't know what [*T*-1] happened to your husband /
he just never came back /
<TURN>
[*PRO*] looked like antlers /
I do n't know /
<TURN>
yep that happens a lot too /
<TURN>
yeah /
oh /
<TURN>
but I guess [0] that 's it /
that 's my opinion on it /
so what now /
<TURN>
I 'm not sure /
<TURN>
uh uh I think [0] we just hang up /
yeah okay /
