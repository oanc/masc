A U. S. lawmaker assessing the impact of U. N. sanctions on Iraq said Wednesday [0] it [*EXP*-1] is important [*PRO*] not only to force Baghdad [*PRO*-2] to give up its weapons of mass destruction but also to do more [*PRO*] to ease the hardships on ordinary Iraqis .
Rep. Tony Hall , D - Ohio , did not call for a lifting of sanctions imposed [*] on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait , but said [0] the United Nations should make [*PRO*] [*EXP*-1] sure that sanctions do not hurt innocent Iraqis .
" It [*EXP*-1] was very , very important " [*PRO*] to compel Iraq [*PRO*-2] to rid itself of weapons of mass destruction so that " it can not use [*?*] or export them to other countries , " he told Associated Press Television News [*T*-3] .
But he insisted [0] the international community can do a much better job in [*PRO*] helping Iraq deal with its economic and health problems .
One way would be [*PRO*] to speed up the flow of health supplies and other urgent commodities to the country under a U. N. humanitarian program , he said [0] [*T*-1] .
