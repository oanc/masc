Patti is the one with the details , I 'm just the deal maker and do n't have access to any of the systems .
All [0] I know [*T*-1] is what fixed priced baseload deals we have [*T*-2] .
I have no idea what [*T*-1] flows .
I hope [0] Patti can help you soon .
[*PRO*] Let me know if you do n't hear from her today .
Thanks , Kim

If I can get all of the information today , I can tell you this afternoon .
It [*EXP*-1] does n't take long [*PRO*] to create the calc sheets .
I understand from Janine that you or Patti can provide me with the detail that I need [*T*-6] .
If necessary , I can come [*PRO*-1] pick it up .
I have sent Patti a list .
For payment , we have [*-1] to forecast the money two days out .
So , if I know today , I can pay on Friday .

[*PRO*] Thanks you so much for [*PRO*] working on these as fast as you have [*?*] - there was a priority in [*PRO*] getting them out .
However , as you know , the less cash outlay that we have [*T*-1] right now the better .
[*PRO*] Let 's {Lets} wait and try [*PRO*-1] to offset the amount [0] we owe them [*T*-2] with what they owe us [*T*-3] - so I say [*PRO*] wait until you get July and August done [*-4] .
What do you think [0] the time frame [*ICH*-2] is [*T*-1] on this ?
And when would be [*T*-1] the earliest that we would make the payment [*T*-2] ?
Thanks , Kim

Kim : I have completed the invoices for April , May and June and we owe Pasadena each month for a total of $ 3,615,910.62 [*U*] .
I am waiting [*PRO*-1] to hear back from Patti on May and June [*PRO*-2] to make [*PRO*] [*EXP*-3] sure [0] they are okay with her .
Do you want me to pay Pasadena on Friday for these months or do you want me to hold off until I finish July and August ?
Again , I do not have all of the information for July and August , so I can not give you any numbers .
If I go by what [*T*-1] is currently in the system as a guide , Pasadena would owe Enron a little over $ 1 mil [*U*] .
I need [*-1] to forecast the money today , so please [*PRO*] let me know what you would like [*PRO*-2] to do [*T*-3] .
FYI - I will be out of the office all next week.
Megan
